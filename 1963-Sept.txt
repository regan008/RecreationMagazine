On the Cover

The forty-seven-foot equestrian
statue of St. Louis IX of France,
St. Louis the Crusader by Charles

H. Niehaus, has long been a trade-
mark of St. Louis, host city for the
45th National Recreation Congress
( see also Pages 307-312). The sta-
tue stands in front of the Art Mu-
seum in Forest Park. The city of
St. Louis was founded as a fur-
trading post by Pierre Laclede and
named for Louis IX. The original
site of the city is now being re-
stored by the JeHerson National
Expansion Memorial Project ad-
ministered hy the National Park
Service.

Next Month
During October we celebrate United

Nations Week (October 2026) and

two articles will deal with interna-
tional aspects of recreation, one
with Peace Corps recreation proj-
ects in Africa and South America,
the other with recreation for US.
Air Force families in Italy. “Drama
in San Quentin” will tell the story
of a theater workshop rehabilita-
tion program operating within the
confines of a prison, while “Folda-
way Theater” explains how to
achieve stunning scenery effects
through the use of ordinary screens.
From Rocky Mount, North Caro-
lina, comes the story of how a town
converted an abandoned water
tower into a community art center.

Blueprint for Success

Sirs:

The article “What Makes a Good
Community Survey” (April and May)
is the finest I have read on this subject!
The techniques, methods, and proced-
ures outlined in the article are virtually
a blueprint of the successful Maricopa
County Parks and Recreation Survey
completed in 1958. The National Rec-
reation Association served as consultant
to our Community Council which ad-
ministered the project. The establish-
ment of our regional park system of
eighty-nine thousand acres is the direct
result of just one of the survey’s many
recommendations. [See “Quick Action
Pays Off,” RECREATION, Jane 1962.]

RECREATION and Mr. Krughoff are to
be complimented for such a timely
article!

KENNETH J. SMITHEE, Director,

Parks and Recreation Department,

M aric0pa County, A rizona.
‘I' * *

May we have permission to make re-
productions of M. F. Krughoff’s “What
Makes a Good Community Survey”?
We intend to ask people who request
assistance in making a community sur-
vey to study the article before proceed-
ing any further. If they decide to pro-
ceed with a study, we feel they will have
an excellent basis to work from. Mr.
Krughoff has put together a thorough
resume of current survey philosophy
and procedure. Survey reports which
“gather dust on the shelves” should
soon be a thing of the past.

L. J. HEEB, State Recreation Consult-

ant, University of Kansas, Lawrence.

Not New
Sirs:

“A Physical Fitness Pilot Project”
[June] stems from World War II days
and the High School Victory Corps-Pro-
gram. The writer used the entire oh-
stacle course described in a scouting
physical fitness program of three thous-
and youngsters. The program was a
district scouting campout. It was amaz-
ing how few passed the program.

Family Fitness
Sirs:

Physical fitness is too often a solitary
undertaking when it could be a natural
part of regular family activity. In Cor-
onado, we have a family that has made
physical activity an integral part of
their family life. Captain and Mrs. Ed-
ward Hildreth have concerned them-

selves with the mental and physical
health of their six children for over
twenty years and could probably lay out
a physical-fitness program which could
fit into the every day life of most of the
families in the United States.

The captain, a naval dentist, plays
tennis regularly and has trophies tucked
away in the garage which he won many
years ago for his swimming ability.
Mrs. Hildreth is an excellent golfer and
can be seen at all swimming meets and
golf tournaments in the area. Sheila,

showed amazing energy as a cheer

'y Two TRAINING CENTERS of the Na-
ional Park Service have been named 1n
Ionor of the first and second d1rectors

3f the NPS, Stephen T. Mather and Hor-
ace M. Albright. The Stephen T. Mat-
her Interpretive Training and Research
Center at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia
-Maryland, established earlier this year,
has a program concerned with methods,
skills, and techniques for NPS person-
nel engaged in the field of interpreta-
tion. The Horace M. Albright Training
Center at Grand Canyon, Arizona, is
a basic training center for uniformed
personnel who normally are assigned

there during their early careers in the
service.

Stephen Mather (1867-1930), a Chi-
cago industrial leader, became the first
director of the NPS in 1917 and served
until 1929. Considered the “Father of
the National Park Service,” Mr. Mather
spent frcely of his personal funds and
time several years before 1917 in the
interest of establishing the NPS. Hor-
ace M. Albright, born in 1890, worked
with Mr. Mather to help establish the
NPS, was the first assistant director un-
der Mr. Mather, and was superinten-
dent Of Yellowstone National Park be-
fore becoming the second NPS director
from 1929 until 1933. Still active in
conservation work, Mr. Mather was re-
cently named to the eleven-member ad-
visory committee of Theodore Roose-
velt Birthplace and Sagamore Hill Na-
tional Historic Sites. He is a resident

of New Rochelle, New York.

of RECREATION.

) ONE OF THE MOST important pieces
of conservation legislation of the 1960’s,
the organic act for the Bureau of Out-
door Recreation (Public Law 88-29),
was signed recently by President Ken-
nedy. It provides Operating authority
and recognition by Congress of the
BOR which has been functioning under
Executive Order for more than a year.

The new law also authorizes the Sec-
retary of the Interior to:

0 Prepare and maintain a continuing
inventory of the outdoor recreation

needs and resources of the United
States.

0 Prepare a system for classification of
outdoor recreation resources.

0 Formulate and maintain a nation-
wide outdoor recreation plan.

0 Provide technical assistance and co-
operate with the states, their political
subdivisions, and private interests.

0 Encourage interstate and regional
cooperation in planning, acquisition,
and develOpment of outdoor recreation.
0 Sponsor, engage in, and assist re-
search and education programs.

0 Encourage interdepartmental coop-
eration and promote coordination of
federal plans and activities generally
relating to outdoor recreation.

:- Accept and use donations for outdoor
recreation purposes.

) FORMATION of a development fund to
preserve what former President Her-
bert Hoover calls “our nation’s most
precious natural resource——our youth”
was announced recently by the Boys’
Clubs of America. Principal purpose of
the fund, to be known as “The Herbert
Hoover DeveIOpment Fund,” is the es-
tablishment of a thousand Boys’ Clubs
serving more than six hundred thou-
sand boys in four hundred cities
throughout the country. Mr. Hoover
has actively served as board chairman

of the Boys’ Clubs of America for
twenty-six years.

) THE AMERICAN PUBLIC is Willing to
pay for recreational use of farm and
industry woodlands but not so willing
to pay for it on government lands, ac-
cording to the findings of a new nation-
wide public opinion survey made for
the forest industry by Opinion Re-
search of Princeton, New Jersey. The
survey also showed:

0 Only one of four persons knows tim-
berlands owned by the forest products
industry are open to the public for rec-
reation.

:- Only four percent of the peOple ever
heard of, or read anything about, the
Wilderness Bill (HR. 930, S. 4) now
pending before Congress.

:- Fifty-six percent of the peOple do
not know that the forests of the country
are growing wood faster than it is be-
ing used and lost to fire, insects, and
disease.

0 The term “multiple use” in relation
to management of timberlands for sev-
eral benefits is known to only a small
proportion of the people and under-
stood by still fewer.

0 Only three out of five peOple are
aware that federal, state, and local gov-
ernments own any forest land at all al-
though these various levels of govern-
ment own thirty-three percent (176,-
000.000 acres) of all commercial for-
est land in the country.

0 The public is considerably more in-
clined to think of forest land in terms
of the economic benefits it affords—
jobs, payrolls, products——than in terms

of social values—such as recreation and
scenery.

) MORE THAN $5,000,000 will be avail-
able for the construction of boating fa-
cilities as a result of marine fuel tax leg-
islation enacted in nine states this year.
The states are Alabama, California.
Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Mon-
tana, New Mexico, and Ohio. On the
federal level, the House Ways and
Means Committee has approved the pro-
vision in the proposed Land and Water

303

Conservation Fund Bill ( H .R. 3835, S.
859) that transfers to the fund the fed-

eral marinc fuel taxes currently going
to the Highway Trust Fund.

} CALIFORNIANS will have another op-
portunity, in November 1964, to decide
whether their state park system needs
enlargement and improvement. Gover-
nor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown recently
signed a bill placing a $150,000,000
bond issue for beaches and parks on
next year’s ballot. The measure is sim-
ilar to one defeated by the voters last
year. In its new form, the bond issue

would earmark $85,000,000 for acqui-
sition of beach and park land, $40,000,-
000 for development, $5,000,000 for
wildlife management lands, and $40,-
000,000 for grants to cities and coun-
ties to develop local and regional
beaches and parks.

) AN AGGRESSIVE street-gang worker
has been granted a Fulbright-Hayes
grant and will leave in September to
carry out a year’s program of academic
study on delinquency prevention and
rehabilitation programs in the United
Kingdom. The grant was awarded to
Frank Ferro, Manhattan Borough di-
rector of the New York City Youth
Board’s Council of Social and Athletic
Clubs, on the basis of his effective work
as an aggressive social worker with
lighting gangs and upon submission of
his detailed proposal on delinquency
prevention and rehabilitation. Mr. Fer-
ro will use the London School of Eco-
nomics as his base of operations and
will study the coordinated services and
programs given multi-problem and de-
prived neighborhoods in London. Dur-
ing his stay he will interview and work
with professionals, youngsters, commu-
nity leaders, and various child-serving
agencies in Great Britain.

) ONE OUT OF SEVEN. The equivalent
of one out of every seven persons in the
United States visited a recreation area
on a Bureau of Reclamation project last
year, according to statistics just re-
leased by the U.S. Department of the
Interior showing a new high of 27,000,-
000 visitor days. This is approximately
four times the number estimated for
1951 and an increase of 1,400,000 over
the 25,600,000 figure for 1961. In
stressing the need for an accelerated
recreation program at reclamation res-
ervoirs, Secretary of the Interior Stew-
art L. Udall stated that because of lim-
ited authority for developing recreation
areas at bureau projects, the potential
of these assets is far from realized. He
declared that enactment of the Land and
Water Conservation Bill ( H .R. 3846, S.
859) now before Congress would lay the
groundwork for greater recreation use
of reclamation projects. This fund for
underwriting more recreation oppor-

304

tunities would be created from several
sources, including the sale of car stamps
to users of federal recreation facilities.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

 

) ATHLETIC COACHES who smoke in the
locker room or on the playing field or
lend their names to the commercial en-
dorsement of cigarettes or alcoholic
beverages are not providing the proper
“hero image” for high school athletes,
according to Josephine Ripley’s column
in the Christian Science Monitor.

That is the conviction of some two
hundred high-school athletic and physi-
cal-education directors of the Confer-
ence on Secondary School Athletic Ad-
ministration meeting recently at the
National Education Association head-
quarters.

What concerns those who work close-
ly with teenagers, as do athletic direc-
tors, is the natural inclination of youth
toward hero worship. “High-school age
students are at a most impressionable
stage given to hero worshipping,” as the
delegates expressed it.

) AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM for teen-
agers on cigarettes and lung cancer has
been stepped up by the American Can-
cer Society with a new nineteen-minute
color film, 15 Smoking Worth It? Its
object is to stimulate classroom discus-
sion and it is built around a discussion
by four teenagers. For information,
write Director of Press Relations, Amer-
ican Cancer Society, Conrad Hilton Ho-
tcl, 7th Street and Michigan Boulcvard,
Chicago.

) RECENT GALLUP SURVEY of U.S. cul-
tural activities reveals that in a twelve-
month period half of the respondents
interviewed had gone to a motion pic-
ture; 46 percent had read a book all the
way through; almost a quarter (24%)
had gone howling; another quarter
(24%) had been to a football game;
17 percent had gone to a basketball
game; 17 percent had visited an art mu-
seum or gallery; 17 percent had gone to
a stage or theater production; 16 per-
cent had played bingo; 13 percent had
gone to a concert or symphony; 12
percent had taken an adult education
course.

> A NATIONWIDE SURVEY of the habits
and preferences of Americans engaged
in outdoor recreation was conducted in
1960-61 by the U.S. Bureau of the Cen-
sus. It was analyzed and reported by
the Outdoor Recreation Resources Re-
view Commission staff (special project
director, Abbott L. Ferris) and is now
available as ORRRC Study Report 19
(U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington 25, D.C., $2.00). The re-

port contains a wealth of information.

SEPTEMBER, 1963

ARTHUR WILLIAMS

Gentleman

of

Leisure

0 NE DAY in October, 1910, a lanky

sixteen-year-old boy hung up

his hat in the office of the Play-
ground Association of America and
went to work. One day in the summer
of 1963, after nearly fifty-three years of
devoted service to the Association, this
same boy reached for his hat in the
office of what is now the National Rec-
reation‘Association and went home—a
retiree. He carries with him the high
regard and affection of the Associa-
tion’s board and staff and of many hun-
dreds of friends in and out of the field
of recreation. Arthur Williams, associ-
ate executive director of the NRA, is,
of course, the only person in the world
about whom these words might be writ-
ten, for no other person may claim the
distinction of having served the Asso-
ciation for so long a time.

Arthur Williams is endowed with a
keen and inquiring mind, a natural flair
for figures and detail, and a remarkably
fine memory. These gifts, together with
a builtvin quality of grit and the ability
to express thoughts with the minimum
of words, have made him invaluable to
the administration of the Association
and as a participant in innumerable
professional and lay meetings involving
such groups as staiff,°board, committee,
workshop, and as an ever-helpful per-
sonal counselor.

He is a thoughtful writer and at his
best in bringing together great masses
of information and material and then
ferreting out the essences contained
therein and expressing the significant
facts in readable style. His periodical
summary statements in the field of rec-
reation and parks will be missed in such
publications as the Municipal Year

Book and the Social Workhl’ear Book

(now the Social Work Encyclopedia).
His broad studies of the recreation
needs of older citizens have made him
a recognized authority in that field. He
served as a special resource person and
as a recorder at the White House Con-
ference on Aging in 1961 and has writ-
ten two outstanding books, Recreation
for the Aging (1953) and Recreation in
the Senior Years (1962) .

L ITERALLY millions of pe0ple unwit-
tingly are indebted to Arthur Wil-
liams. Many of them do not know him,
as he has not had direct contact with
their lives. However, through his wise
counseling in many groups devoted to
the different phases of recreation, he
has helped to guide the recreation move-
ment in such a way as to bring greater
recreation satisfactions to service men
and women around the world, to senior
citizens everywhere, to participants and
spectators alike in the field of sports and
athletics, and to that great army of
youngsters who enjoy and have enoyed
for many years the public playgrounds
of the U.S.A.

Arthur Williams is a modest, un-
assuming person with qualities of gen-
tleness and kind, thoughtful considera-
tion known best to those who are closely
associated with him. He has a thor-
oughly justifiable pride in the accom-
plishments of his brilliant son, Dr. Pe-
ter Williams, who is a university pro-
fessor in Canada. His broad circle of
friends can vicariously enjoy Arthur’s
retirement with him, remembering that
at his Long Island, New York, home on
Great South Bay his favorite items of
equipment are the lawnmower and the
rocking chair and that his very best

friend is his good wife, Helen. #

THE
ANATOMY

OF A
CONGRESS

CHARLES E. HARTSOE

SEPTEMBER, 1963

The annual National Recreation Congress is defined as “the only
national meeting at which professionals, volunteers, and civic lead-
ers concerned with all aspects of recreation get together to discuss
problems, trends and new techniques directed toward helping all
Americans make the most of their expanding leisure time.” How-
ever, the spirit behind the Congress goes far beyond this definition.

THE CONGRESS IS THE CREATION of dedicated people throughout the country
who believe in the important and human values of recreation and
who have been willing to direct their time, energies, and resources
in a national effort to bring to all of us in the recreation movement
an opportunity for personal and agency growth and for improving
recreation services throughout the nation.

THE CONGRESS IS A COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE sponsored by two national recrea-
tion organizations and cooperatively supported by recreation and
park agencies and associations at the state and local level. It is a
spirit of unity toward a common goal.

THE CONGRESS IS A CITY—this year, St. Louis—that extends its hospitality
to the recreation movement. It is a local arrangements committee
working diligently. It is the opening of doors and the organization

of the city’s resources to bring you an unforgettable experience. It
is local pride, enthusiasm, and creativeness at its best.

THE CONGRESS IS A ROUND-THE-ClOCII FORUM—both formal and informal. It
is an inspiring speaker, a panel presentation, a workshop, a group
discussion, a committee meeting. It is a visit to the exhibit area, a
chat in the lobby, a leisurely walk at dusk with a colleague. It is a
continuing educational experience. It is knowledge gained and new
ideas and approaches exchanged.

THE CONGRESS IS NATIONAl DIRECTION of grass-roots expression. It is a pro-
gram concept and idea developed and shaped in Austin, Texas, in
St. Louis, Missouri, in Northridge, California, in Colorado Springs,
Colorado, in Logansport, Indiana, in Amherst, Massachusetts, in
New York City, in Washington, DC, and in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina. It is a local concept transmitted, communicated, and de-
velOped in the planning stage and presented, challenged, defended,
and refined at the national convention stage.

THE CONGRESS IS A SHOWPIACE OT RECREATION . . . the newest equipment and
supplies . . . the latest in recreation and park facilities . . . the out-
standing thinkers and leaders of the movement.

THE CONGRESS IS A PRECIOUS MOMENT of fellowship between leaders of like
cause. It is the renewing of old acquaintance, the making of new
friends.

THE CONGRESS IS AN INVESTMENT in YOU, your agency, and your community.
It is a report back to your board or managing authority and your
staff. It is a reevaluation of self and program.

THE NATIONAl RECREATION CONGRESS IS YOU, your participation, your sup-
port. (For this year’s Congress program see Pages 310-312.) #

MR. HARTSOE is secretary of the National Recreation Congress.

David P. Wold Center is a recreator’s dream come true

Delegates will see it at the 45th National Recreation Congress

MRS. EDWARD G. BRUNGARD

GREAT THINGS
arehappening
to municipal ree-
reation in St. Lou-
is. During the past
ten years, $11,-
000,000 in bond
issue funds have
been devoted to meeting the increasing
demand for park and recreation facili-
ties in the Gateway City to the west.
One of St. Louis’ newest additions to
meet the challenging need for recrea-
tion facilities is the $850,000 David
P. Wohl Recreation Center.

This modern community and recrea-
tion center is a beehive of fun-filled
leisure-time activities. Just about every
type of recreation activity is provided
in this award-winning center. Over 150
community groups use its modern gym-
nasium; even the candidates of the
FBI’s Academy use the center’s facili-
ties as part of their physical fitness pro-
gram. The center plays host to over
seven thousand persons a week in every
form of activity from banquets to art
classes, from swimming instruction to
cooking and sewing classes.

A big highlight of the recreation pro-
gram at the center is the in-sehool learn-
to-swim program. This program, spon-
sored by the St. Louis Division of Ree-
reation in cooperation with the St.

Louis Board of Education, provides
hasic

 

instructions for
in neighborhood public
schools as part of the schools’ formal
physical-education program. Young-
sters are brought to the pools by the

youngsters

tion, and Forestry.

IN THE SWIM . . .]

physical-education instructors and the
center’s aquatic staff provide the swim-
ming instructions.

Let’s take a quick look at this center
and see why it has been consideer “a
recreator’s dream come true.” The
Wohl Recreation Center is located on
a sloping site in Sherman Park. Its
unique design won the Award of Merit
of the Architectural Achievement Com-
petition of the St. Louis Chapter of the
Producers’ Council, Incorporated.

The exterior of the building features
structural columns painted a deep char-
coal contrasting with light buff brick
and orange porcelain-enamel truss
Panels of blue and yellow por-
eelain above and below the steel win-
dows give the structure a gay air.

The main entrance is reached from
Kingshighway Boulevard by means of
a wide walk. A beautiful wall of Palos
Verde stone, a concrete planting box
incorporating a corner stone, a fifty-
foot tapered steel flagpole, and a steel
canopy projecting forty-five feet from
the building form an interesting group-
ing at the main entrance. The main
recreation lobby is the core for all ac-
tivities providing access to the center
director’s office, coatroom, the multi-
purpose room, gymnasium, men’s and
women’s dressing and locker rooms,
and public restrooms.

ends.

THE CENTRAL FEATURE of the center

is a swimming pool designed not
only for outdoor swimming in the sum-
mer, but as an indoor pool for the bal-
ance of the year. The pool, measuring
forty-two by seventy-five feet, has a
pale-blue vinyl-plastic lining with white
line markers of the same material, and

a capacity of 142,000 gallons. The en-

tire amount of water is recirculated
through a diatomaceous earth filtering
system every eight hours. A terra-cotta
colored non-slip concrete deck of 4,488
square feet surrounds the pool. The
pool has a structural glazed tile (ten

feet high) and haydite block wall (above
tile to ceiling) to the north. The south
wall is of 12-by-12-inch clear glass block.
The east and west walls each have five
sets of double metal and glass vertical
lift doors each seventeen feet wide and
ten feet high, separated by air space
approximately a foot wide. Twelve feet
high 12-by-12-ineh clear glass block
panels are over these doors with the re-
maining six feet high space between
trusses closed with elcar sheet glass.

A ccment plaster finish defines the
trusses for a distance of seven feet from
the glass at the east and west walls at
which point the plaster drops to the
bottom of the trusses. A white baked-
enamel perforated aluminum ceiling
supported on inverted aluminum ties
six feet on center with fiberglass blanket
above for acoustical correction fills the
sixty-foot space between the plaster
drops. Incandescent lights are recessed
into this ceiling with maintenance from
ahove via catwalks.

Warm-air registers in the plaster
drops direct air toward the glass walls
to keep them free of condensation. This
air passes between the double vertical
lift doors and is returned at the base of
the steel housings for the counter-
weights between the doors. During the
summer months, these vcrtieal lift doors
are opened for maximum ventilation.

comes available for use on the east and
west sides.

The dressing and locker areas are
reached through doors and baffled pas-
sageways from the recreation lobby. A
total of 202 lockers are provided for
men and 115 for women. In addition
to the gang showers and open dressing
areas, three semi-private shower stalls
and dressing booths are provided for
the women. Three electric hair dryers
are provided for the women as well as
bathing suit wringers for both men and
women. Both dressing areas have di-
rect access to the exterior through baf-
fled and vestibuled passageways. Walls
are of structural glazed tile with smooth
plaster or exposed concrete ceilings.

The pool access is located at the shal-
low end of the pool through baffled pas-
sageways from each dressing area. The
pool has a minimum depth of three and
a half feet and a maximum depth of
ten feet. Two one-meter boards are pro-
vided with four chrome ladders, one
at each corner. The pool has a curb
and scum gutter of structural glazed tile
with depth and distance markings fired
into the ceramic glaze.

THE GYMNASIUM, 74~by-110 feet of
maple flooring, provides regulation
basketball, volleyball, badminton, and
other courts. Included also are folding
bleachers with a seating capacity for
420 spectators, an electric scoreboard,
four practice basketball goals, two fly-
ing rings, two climbing ropes, and hori-
zontal ladder. A large storage room
f l 7’-by-35’) is located at the north end
of the gymnasium.
A 32-by-34-foot craft room is located
to the north of the gymnasium and is
reached from the main corridor. Am-

ple storage closets and a sink is pro-
vided in this room. Structural glazed
tile walls, the 2-by-4-foot aluminum-
grid ceiling with acoustical board in-
serts or recessed fluorescent lights, and
an asphalt-tile floor provide the decor
of this room.

A mezzanine floor, accessible from a
stairway located in the recreation
lobby, houses a fan room and a boxing
and wrestling room. The latter is 36-
by-4‘0 feet and features a lG-by-16-foot
boxing ring. Two punching bags are
also provided. Painted haydite block
is used for the walls with a ceiling simi-
lar to that in the gymnasium. Floors
are cement.

THE LARGE multi-purpose room, 39-

by-99 feet, can be subdivided by
folding soundproof partitions. The
three smaller rooms are used for sep-
arate activities such as ballet classes,
Ping-pong, club meetings, luncheons,
and other similar activities. Individual
doors provide access to each area.
Structural glazed-tile walls in the multi-
purpose room contrast with the natural
wood, 'dividing partitions, and sliding
door closets. An accent panel of ran-
dom-colored glazed tile at the south end
of the room adds a touch of gaiety to
the pleasant decor.

A kitchen is located at the north end
of the multi-purpose room. A serving
counter provides for convenient food
service on occasions when the room is
used for banquets. The kitchen has
limited cooking facilities so food for
large groups must be provided by cater-
ers. Ample counter space in the kitchen
permits use for cooking classes and
demonstrations.

There are recessed fluorescent trof-

fers with low-brightness glass lenses in
the crafts room, multi-purpose room,
and exercise area. There are recessed

incandescent fixtures in the entrance
lobby with accent lights in a large
trophy case. The gymnasium lights are
of a type that are not only adequate for
competitive sports, but also allow this
area to be used for group work and
functional training. The gymnasium is
also provided with a remote-operated
electric scoreboard.

The pool is lighted by eighteen 500-
watt fixtures producing ten-foot candles
so as to insure adequate lighting of the
pool surface and surrounding areas.
The pool is provided with nineteen 750-
watt underwater lights arranged and
designed to eliminate hazards to the
bathers, and yet provide a lighting in-
tensity that under all conditions, will in-
sure complete observation of all parts
of the pool by lifeguard personnel. The
outdoor decks are illuminated hy re-
flector floodlights located on the ex-
terior wall of the pool and the parking
area is completely lighted by three
standards containing two floodlights
each. '

All swimming pool, locker, and
shower areas may be completely washed
and sanitized, thanks to the adequate
placement of hose outlets and the
proper sloping of the floors to the floor
drainage openings. The sanitary drain
lines, roof drainage, and perimeter
drain tile are connected to the city
drainage facilities. A system of cold
water and recirculatcd hot water has
been designed and sized to insure an
adequate supply at all times to all fix-
tures. The water heater is a steam-sup-
plied storage-type heater, with a stor-

MONUMENT

Generous citizens show vision

in making gift of parkland

for a local recreation area

BEVERLY R. GOLDBERG

LIVING IMONUMENT [0 the gener-
A osity of public-spirited citizens
and to the foresight of municipal
government oHicials is being enjoyed
daily by‘hundreds pf personsr-in Abing-
ton Township, a suburb of Philadelphia.
Alverthorpe Park, the gift of Mr. and
Mrs. Lessing J. Rosenwald, is being
developed by the township’s parks and
recreation department into a mag-
nificent new recreation area. (Dele-
. gates to last year’s National Recreation
Congress in Philadelphia will remember
that Mr. and Mrs. Rosenwald received a.
citation from the National Recreation
Association for their great contribution
to the township and recreation.)

The Rosenwalds contributed fifty-
four acres from their estate, Alver-
thorpe, to the township for creation of
the park. More than $300,000 has been
spent by Abington Township in shaping
the beautifully wooded tract into what
recreation experts describe as “one of
the finest municipal parks in the na-
tion.”

The Elwood Allen Organization was
retained to plan the park and an Alver-
thorpe Park Advisory Committee was
formed of knowledgeable citizens. The
early planning and°development of the
park, to meet the outdoor recreation
needs of the township’s fifty-six thous-
and citizens, have been carried out with
the continuing help of National Recrea-
tion Association field and headquarters
services.

 

MRS. GOLDBERG is a staff writer with the
f e n h i n t o w n , Pennsylvania, Timcs

Chronicle.

SEPTEMBER, 1963

Mr. Rosenwald, retired chairman of
the board of directors of Sears Roebuck
and Company, conceived the idea in
1958, and a phone call to William H.
Yost, township commissioner in the Al-
verthorpe district, started the ball'roll:
ing. Abington’s Board of Commis-
sioners recognized the Opportunity this
offer afforded, and promptly took steps
to assure its deve10p1nent in effectivc
fashion. Township funds were chan-
neled to the park, the position of super-
intendent of parks and recreation was
created, and filled by James C. Dittmar.

Hub of Alverthorpe’s activity is its
multiple-use area. This contains a 200-
by-70-foot concrete-surface area lined
for volleyball, tennis, paddle tennis,
basketball, badminton, and shuflle-
board. It can be quickly cleared for
roller skating, social and square danc-
ing, and other group games. In winter
it is used for ice-skating. Adjacent are a
baseball diamond with bleachers, three
softball diamonds, and four horseshoe
pitching courts.

The elementary-school child is at-
tracted by eye-catching, red-and-white
candy-striped recreation apparatus. He
can slide down a fireman’s pole, wriggle
through a space station, or sprint to the
top of a slanted shield. He can choose
up sides on a softball diamond or can
quench his thirst at the refreshment
concession in the modern park shelter.

The preschooler’s imagination can

children’s play center. This is built
around a workshop where children are
permitted to experiment with available
materials. A miniature tricycle turnpike

Alverthorpe has the only municipally

course in suburban Philadelphia. The
nine holes, lighted for night play, chal-

the beginner. All greens are guarded
by sand traps—a rarity on most par-
three courses—and strategically placed
tee positions require accuracy in hitting
to the greens.

The holes on the imaginatively dc-
signed course range from the forty-yard

l20-yard ninth. Since the course meas-
ures only 1,430 yards for eighteen holes,
a foursome can play a round in about
an hour and a half. This gives the busy
housewife or harried executive an 0p-
portunity to play without it being a
time-consuming experience. The night
lighting is accomplished by fifty-four
1,500-watt bulbs mounted on twenty-
scven standards, each forty feet high.

The public is charged for participat-
ing in only three of Alverthorpe’s activi-
ties. During the day, eighteen holes of
golf can be played for $1.00, an increase
to $1.50 is charged for night play. In
both cases clubs are provided. On week-
ends, holidays, and evenings tennis
players are charged $.25 an hour. The
courts are free during weekdays.

At the group picnic shelter, $.25 pcr
person is charged for those over twelve
years of age. PeOple using the reserved
shelter receive the use of restrooms,
electricity, a large grill, and a recrea-
tion area.

“Tomorrow” for Alverthorpe Park is
very much under consideration. The
Abington Township Board of Commis-
sioners is presently considering meth-
ods of financing the development of an
additional seventy-six acres of the Alver-
thorpe tract which the liosenwalds have
indicated they will contribute. Proposed
for this future development are an addi-
tional nine holes of golf; an outdoor
theater for concerts and dramatic pro-
ductions; a lake for canoeing and ice
skating; an overnight camping area;
day camp area; nature trails and a na-
ture museum; coasting and skiing
areas; and the acquisition of the lioscn-
wald’s existing home for use as a cul-
tural center.

“The Rosenwald gift to Abington
Township was a wonderful thing,” says
Mr. Dittmar. “The foresight they have
shown in preserving thesc acres of open
space for future generations is highly
commendable. Perhaps others through-
out the country will be stimulated to
make similar contrihutions to their own
municipalities as a result of the wonder-
ful success of this classic example of
teamwork between private citizens and

local government.” #

The Descending Spiral

3y what will future generations
fudge us?

 

 

AUGUST H ECKSCH ER

HE WIDESPREAD, lively interest in the
T development of the arts—you can
discern it in the press, you can feel it
amid the public and even in the Con-
gress—is a symptom of a deep move-
ment in public opinion, one of those
transformations in our habits and ways

 

of thinking which, once in a generation
or so, creates wholly fresh demands and possibilities. Some-
times this enthusiasm for ‘culture seems a little overwhelm-
ing. One fears that, where such winds are blowing, nice
distinctions are going to get lost and the highest standards
will prove diHicult to maintain. The difference betwcen the
excellent and the second-rate, between the genuine and the
spurious, between the artist and the amateur are perhaps
now in more danger of becoming blurred than in periods
when the arts are neglected. However, the capacity to ap-
preciate and enjoy, and the energy to create, certainly exist
in a high degree among us. They may yet bring us into an
age of cultural achievement such as our country has never
known.

The maintenance of beauty and fitness in the environ-
ment—a sort of comeliness in the world around us-—is
wholly as important as other forms of culture in determin-
ing the quality of a society. The things that are created by
men working together, consciously or unconsciously, are the
most durable facts about a civilization. They outlast the
living generation; they carry forward. to be modified by
time and by new men, the body of an age. Where we find
that men have built meanly, without common purpose or 3

sense of the ideal, we can be sure that they lived meanly
also—or, at the very least, that they lived with a dispr0por-
tionate emphasis on the private sphere of life, neglecting the
influences which can make a civilization out of an accumula-
tion of individual existences.

What, after all, do we mean by a civilization? It is surely
not the accumulation of private things; nor is it, necessarily,
the building of public things. In the Republic, Plato com-
plained of those who had heaped up physical structures and
yet missed the most important aspects of a true civilization.
They have filled the city, Plato complains, “full of harbors
and docks and buildings and all that,” and have “left no
room for temperance or justice.” Many of those arguing
that we have overdeveloped the private sector while neglect-
ing the public sector fall into this fallacy; they seem to sug-
gest that money Spent in the puhlic realnl is necessarily and
in all circumstances a boon.

Granted there are public needs poorly met and some not
met at all, still a transfer of funds from the private to the
public budget is no assurance of a higher degree of ma-
turity and civilization. A civilization requires “temperance-
and justice” at the core——an inner sense of values in the
light of which decisions are made. It implies an external
order of things which are not only beautiful in their own
way but correspond to a pe0ple’s intrinsic sense of what
is good.

IIE NEXT DECADES will be a period of vast building and
T of great physical transformations of the American
scene. It is not only that goods will pour from the factories.
New highways will criss-cross the country. Cities will be
torn down and rebuilt. The countryside will be made over
into new forms of urban and suburban communities. Yet
all this activity will not in itself mean a civilization is being
shaped. A civilization begins to manifest itself when men
and women have begun to take thought about what it is they

315

construct, and why, and to what end. It begins to be a living
whole when the idea of beauty has found its place alongside
the pressure of utility and the spur of need.

In the past history of this country, the outward pattern
of things has, to an extraordinary degree, been left to chance,
to the haphazard actions of special interests and groups.
Sometimes it has seemed that as a nation we simply did not
concern ourselves with the face of the land. The American
continent was so huge, its resources of land and forests and
water so unbounded, that, though men chopped away at
them with only their own interests in mind, we trusted that
the great bulk of things would remain unspoiled. Some-
times we have assumed that private interests working com-
petitively would create their own kind of fitness.

In strange ways, this has often happened. The farming
landscape, whether tightly knit in New England or spread
across the Mid-Western miles, has its peculiar beauty. The
New York skyline reveals a spirit that no sculpture could
have matched. However, there are limits beyond which this
faith in automatic artistry cannot be pushed. Where these
limits are passed over, as in the sprawling roadside slums
or the monotonous housing developments, the results have
often been appalling and the public has appeared to stand
by helplessly.

Public agencies undertaking to mold the landscape or
drastically alter the environment have most frequently acted
with a single interest in mind—to speed up traffic, to stop
floods, to put roofs over needy people. All these separate
things may be to the good, but the fact that these interven-
tions were the work of lonely enthusiasts or of bureaucratic
experts suggests that something has been amiss. Where was
there a concern for harmony? Where was that sense of the
whole which alone can give beauty and meaning to what
men accomplish by their common toil?

When we look about us at the natural environment today
we are struck by the degree to which it is subject to human
designs. No part of it is safe from the bulldozer, the land
speculator, the engineer, and the road-builder. When Theo-
dore Roosevelt and Governor Pinchot started the conserva-
tion movement in 1908, their problem was essentially that
of preserving a few key areas or of instituting practices
which allowed natural resources to endure and to reproduce
themselves. Since then, the power of man over nature has
increased enormously. The great advances in human organ-
ization, in science and technology, have literally put into our
hands the fate of a vast continental expanse. What we do
with it is for us to decide. The forests that sheltered our
grandfathers we now shelter and preserve. The land that
kept them is now in our keeping. We possess the earth as
in no sense could it have been said of any previous gen-
eration.

On sentimental journeys, on campaigns, and outings of
a summer season, the Americans show themselves still affect-
ingly aware of the values implicit in a noble environment.
lf only they could heed as attentively the landscape which
surrounds them through the rest of the year! It is one
thing, they seem to feel, to retreat into the silence and loneli-
ness of a forest (at least as much silence and loneliness as
their ever-increasing numbers afford) but another thing‘ to

316

expect beauty or fitness in their everyday surroundings.
They want a national park three thousand miles away; they
do not seem to care——or to care enough—if there is no park
to which they can motor on a Sunday or one to which they
can walk in their lunch hour. They want the wilderness
forever wild, but seem unheeding if the roadsides are for-
ever cluttered with billboards.

UDGED by the apparent attitude of too many present-day
Americans, there is douht whether we shall ever be able

to extricate ourselves from a descending spiral of ugliness
and irrationality. What is required is readiness to under-
take on a large scale the kind of public works which are
truly public—in the sense that they serve the highest in-
terests of the citizenry; and truly works—in the sense that
they are made to endure and to be judged by future gen-
erations. Yet it is this kind of undertaking for which it is
often most difficult to muster support among the people.
No foreign threat is so intangible but it can evoke a readi-
ness to sacrifice and even a positive enthusiasm -for the or-
deal. No project, however costly or tenuous its returns, will
be seriously challenged by the public if it can be shown that
undertaking it will increase our material power. However,
if it is proposed that something be done by the people for
their own delight and for the enhancement of their common
life, a dead silence ensues. If someone suggests elegance
in a public huilding, the matter is hushed up as if it were a
scandal.

We have been preparcd to call on the best architects in
the country when it has been a matter of huilding abroad.
The embassies and consulates that have been constructed in
various countries over the past decade remind us what the
United States can do—-and what government can do—when
it scts bcauty and excellence as a goal. The cultural ccnter
built by the nation for the people of Wcst Berlin shows that
we are not unmindful of the value of a setting in which
great public events can bc fittineg held. At home, howevcr,
the story is different. We still wait to see accomplished a
national cultural center in Washington. We might well feel
impelled to ask, in regard to our own public huildings,
whether we consider ourselves to be so backward or un-
civilized that we cannot enjoy the kind of beauty which we
prepare for otllcrs.

We feel impelled to ask such a question—and yet in some
dim way, we scnse an answer more hopeful than the face of
things might scem to warrant. For there is ccrtainly an
influencc taking shapc which promises for the America of
tomorrow a more sane appreciation of the true values which
make a civilization. The environment can be man’s greatest
work of art; and it cannot be that while we strive for ex-
cellence and beauty in specific forms of culture—in paint-
ing, in sculpture, in literature, in poetry and music—we
shall permanently minimize the significance of the outward
world which surrounds us from our birth and insensibly
makes us what we are.

YET I would remind you of the other side of the coin. It
would be all too easy to fail from the error of under-
estimating the importance of beauty in the environment to

San Diego’s civic pride
leads it into

exciting growth

It’s always happy-ending time

in operettas such as

The Forest Prince, which

provide excellent training ground

for youngsters who will eventually
become members of San Diego’s

many adult theatrical and music groups.

SEPTEMBER, 1963

NCREASED AWARENESS of cultural val-
ues in the West’s burgeoning metro-
politan centers has intimately in-

volved the attention of recreation lead-
ers. In San Diego, California, where the
population has trebled since 1940, rec-
reation planners have seen the character
of the city change from a placid com-
munity off the beaten path to a sophisti-
cated and dynamic hub for well over six
hundred thousand urban and a million
urban—suburban residents. With such
growth and character change comes a
complete overhauling of cultural re-
sources. Symphony orchestras become
a matter of civic pride, art galleries are
built, little theater sprouts up every-
where, plans proceed for adequate civic
auditoriums and concert halls, ballet
groups are formed. All this is true any-
where, but in California’s coastal com-
munities where tourism is a major-———if
not the major—industry, the emphasis
on cultural development is extraor-
dinary indeed.

MR. TREMBLEY is public information

ogicer of the San Diego, California,
Park and Recreation Department.

 

San Diego Park and Recreation De-
partment administrators, sensing this
trend at its onset following World War
ll, established a youth symphony and
added a director to the staff. A position
was then created to supervise all social
and creative activities, after which the
Junior Civic Ballet was formed. Later
the Junior Theatre was created, with a
director hired to guide its destinies.
Programs of dancing, dramatics, and
music were augmented on the play-
ground level, and the department in-
creased its cooperative efforts with in-
numerable civic groups, such as the
symphony, the San Diego Community
Theatre, the Starlight Opera Company,
art galleries, museums, art-and-craft
groups, and the Southern California As-
sociation of Photographic Clubs.

More than a need to keep pace with
the city’s cultural growth was involved.
The city’s creative programs became a
training ground for future members of
the summer and winter adult symphony
groups, for dancers and singing leads
in the outdoor operettas in Balboa Park,
for actors in the famous Old Globe
Theatre’s year-round dramatic sched-

317

ule, and for participants in an amazing
number of adult clubs organized around
mutual cultural interests.

Formation of these creative activities
for juniors grew out of a need, but be-
fore they became the local traditions
they now are, a considerable amount of
activity and promotion was necessary.
This took the form of a year-round pro-
gram of public events, which provided
youngsters with a proving ground for
their talent while offering public enter-

tainment.

YPICAL of these events is the sum-
T mer operetta offered by young
people in an outdoor bowl seating over
forty-two hundred. Junior Civic Ballet
groups work on this all surmner, but it
also involves outstanding singers, ac-
tors, and dancers from San Diego’s
younger population who qualify for
leads at auditions. The San Diego
Youth Symphony accompanies the pro-
duction, usually playing music by
Tchaikowsky, Moldau, or by composers
of comparable stature. Junior Theatre
trainees may become involved as cast
memhers or in backstage work on scene
design.

Youth Symphony concerts, Junior
Theatre productions, Junior Civic Ballet
appearances on such events as the
Easter Parade of Wheels, the Christmas
program, and city-wide extravaganzas,
such as a folk festival sponsored by the
Elks Club, ofler further showcases for
youthful talent as well as incentives for
the many hours of rehearsals. Equally
important is the fact that these events
advertise the activity to the public. The
Junior Theatre may be good for one
feature story a year in the local press,
but each one of its individual produc-
tions justifies numerous news stories
and listings in calendars of events.

Admission is charged at some of the
larger events, but it is kept at a mini-
mum. The real suhsidy to support these
programs comes from fees collected by
the city from participants in the pro-
gram. There is also a great effort made
to recruit volunteer supervision from
talented members of the general public.
This may extend from dramatic coach-
ing by a prominent local actor to
mothers of cast members of an operetta
spending long hours sewing costumes.
Another source of free manpower be-
hind the scenes of the productions is. of

318

course, the youngsters themselves. The
prima ballerina may turn out to be one
of the hardest workers in the wardrobe
department between rehearsals.

The three major divisions of the de-
partment’s cultural program are the
Junior Civic Ballet, the Youth Sym-
phony and the Junior Theatre. All have
their headquarters in twelve hundred-
acre Balboa Park, an ideal backdrop
for such activities. Also in the park are
a wide variety of square, round, and
folk dancing classes meeting weekly and
programs offered in the summer and oc-
casionally during the school year by in-
stitutions related to the department but
governed by boards of their own. These

 

Youngsters in the Junior Civic Ballet
participate in many special events and
city-wide extravaganzas. This was part
of a production for an Easter program.

include classes in art, natural history,
anthropology, lndian lorc, zoology, and
many phases of science.

San Diego’s Junior Civic Ballet, the
only civic-sponsored ballet for young
people in the United States, was formed
in 1947. Some thrce hundred enrollces
ranging in agc from eight to eighteen
participate in three semesters, fall, sum-
mer, and spring. The youngsters put in
from one to one-and-a-half hours a week
during school and from one-and-a-half
to four-and-a-half hours during the sum-
mer vacation on instruction, but re-
hearse daily prior to productions. Pro-
ductions include the operetta
Christmas programs already mentioned
as well as a newly instigated spring bal-
let. demonstrations and special evcnts

and

given throughout the year. Fees are
$3.50 a semester.

The department’s supervisor of cul-
tural activities and an assistant provide
instruction with the assistance of stu-
dents from the most advanced group.
Instruction is divided into eight phases
rated by ability. No tryouts or pro-
ficiency tests are rcquired to enroll in
ballet, but advancement through the dif-
ferent classes is strictly on the basis of
proficiency. All those in the most ad-
vanced group have had at least four
years in the classes.

Aim of this program is to develop
poise and assurance as well as to afford
a sense of accomplishment and pleasure.
Among the ballets produced have been

“The Twelve Dancing Princesses,” “The
Ballet of the Seasons,” “The Snow

Queen,” and “The Snow Maiden.”

Junior Theatre also has the same
three semesters as ballet and is for boys
and girls from eight to eightecn. Classes
here break down into eight to ten years,
eleven to thirteen years, and teenage
for the workshops, which meet on Sat-
urday mornings and Thursday aftcr-
noons during the school semester and
every weekday during the summer.
There are also creative play-acting
classcs for five to scvcn year-olds. Fees
are all 315 a semester, plus $2.50 dues
to belong to the Junior Theatre Club.

Among other subjects covered in the
workshops are creative dance, choral
speaking, puppetry, rhythmic move-
ment, stagecraft and creative acting.
Thrce large productions are staged each
year in a large public auditorium, in
addition to which Junior Theatre takes
part in productions with the Youth
Symphony and Junior Civic Ballet.

BOTH Junior Theatre and the Youth
Symphony have adult boards of di-
rcctors who guide policies of these ac-
tivities, assist in promotion of produc-
tions and help in various ways. The
Youth Symphony datcs back to 1945.
lts members are sometimes as young as
eleven and as old as twenty-one, but
all must qualify by audition. The sev-
enty-five or so youthful musicians re-
hearsc three hours each Monday night
throughout the year and present large
concerts in the fall and spring. Addi-
tionally, they appear in special conccrts
l as in nearby Mexico) or provide
music for Operettas, musicals, or ballets

RECREATION

nvolving other youth groups. Fees are
' $5 a semester with the same semester
breakdown as the other two institutions.
Soloists for the formal concerts are
auditioned and chosen by a panel of
judges. Concerts are free. In the sum-
mer a Junior Youth Symphony is
formed of the younger and less skilled
members, and this group gives a concert
at summer’s end in Balboa Park.
Although most San Diegans take as
their due the unique service in this
“food for the mind and soul” area pro-
vided by the park and recreation de-
partment, it has often been shown that
they are willing to turn out en masse to
protect and foster thesc activities when
necessary. Thus it is that the city’s cul-
tural and creative needs are recognized
and given equal place with athletic,
aquatic, and social recreation. #

OUTDOOR SKILLS

Skilled mountaineers and woodsmen
demonstrated their skills during a two-
day “outdoor weekend” this summer in
F ranconia Notch State Park, New
Hampshire. Veteran rock climbers from
the Appalachian Mountain Club simu-
lated a rescue mission on the face of a
near-vertical cliff and demonstrated
climbing techniques over the heads of
the crowd. Hardy voyageurs, who earn
their living guiding sportsmen in New
Hampshire’s rugged Connecticut Lakes
region, pitted brawn, brain, and speed
against one another at Echo Lake in the
annual New Hampshire Guides Show.
Sponsored by the New Hampshire Divi-
sion of Parks, all events were open to
the public without charge.

Exhibits of climbing, rescue, and
first-aid equipment were on display, and
AMC oHicials explained all phases of
climbing, use of proper equipment, and
mountain safety. A traditional Fran-
conia Notch event for the past several
years, the Guides Show featured brawny
outdoorsmen, all members of the New
Hampshire Guides Association from
Pittsburg, in robust contests of log-roll-
ing, chopping and sawing, canoe-tilting,
canoe-humping, a tug-of-war, log rac-
ing, single and double canoe races, and
other contests of muscle and endurance.
The veteran guides also competed in
moose-calling, fly-casting, kettle-boil-
ing, and other events.

GUIDE FOR JOINT USE OF FACILITIES

Policies set up in Austin, Texas, by the city administration

in the joint use and development

of school and recreation facilities

suggest procedures for other communities

0 BEST PROVIDE opportunities for
T recreation and to offer the com-
munity the greatest possible
benefits from its investments in public
expenditures, careful and early plan-
ning is necessary. This was carried out
in Austin, Texas, where public schools
and the city department of recreation
planned together for the joint acquisi-
tion and use of recreation facilities. To
accomplish the desired results, mutually
accepted policies are desirable. This
procedure will also assure continuity
and permanency of the program. Aus-
tin’s policies follow:

IT IS GENERALLY recognized that neigh-
borhood playgrounds are a basic
facility in a successful community rec-
reation program; and it is desirable
that they be a functional part of ele-
mentary-school grounds. Policies of ac-
quisition of land and its development
should deal primarily with elementary
school sites and neighborhood recrea-
tion areas. This does not imply that
consideration cannot, or will not, be
given other projects of greater magni-
tude.

As far as possible, the joint commit-
tee of city and school representatives
shall meet quarterly to discuss the car-

322

rying out of these policies and Special
problem of streets, sewerage, utilities.
and so 011. Following are policies which
shall apply to purchase of sites, plan-
ning new construction, joint use of
buildings and grounds, and programs:

Acquisition of
Neighborhood Sites

1. Since it is the duty of the board
of trustees of the school district to se-
lect school sites, such sites shall be lo-
cated primarily to meet educational
needs, the probable need of the city be-
ing held in consideration.

2. Upon the tentative selection of a
site the city manager will be notified
of its location by letter from the super-
intendent of schools, copies being sent
to the director of planning and director
of recreation.

3. At the earliest possible date the
city authorities will notify the school
district of the city’s intention relative
to a joint project.

Character of Sites
1. In the selection of school sites to
be used in joint neighborhood play-
grounds the following factors shall be
considered:
0 The area shall be such that a free
area of approximately six acres will be

available for playground use. This area
shall be exclusive of the area occupied
by the building as determined by its
maximum overall dimensions. '

0 The general topography of the pro-
posed site.

0 The distance of travel to the site by
the major clement of population.

0 Accessibility of the site.

Planning New Construction
Although the school authority has the

principal rcsponsibility for the plan-
ning of the school building, some guid-
ing principles for the planning of the
building for joint use are recognized:
I. As far as possible, the following
principles will be used in developing
the school buildings:
0 All public school buildings, located
where provision for community recrea-
tion facilities is determined to be ad-
visable, should be planned and c011-
structed to serve effectively not only the
requirement of the school program, but
where practical, and additional expen-
ditures are not necessary, the needs of
all the pe0ple of the neighborhood and
community for a broad recreation pro-
gram sbould be included.
0 Authorities responsible for admin-
istering community recreation activities

RECREATION

to be provided in the school buildings
should be consulted in the planning of
those facilities intended for community
recreation use.

0 Facilities designed for community
recreation use should be grouped as far
as practical in one area of the school
building. Such functional arrangements
as limits access to other parts of the
building, making possible efficient con-
trol,-and economical maintenance and
operation, should be considered.

0 Recreation facilities in school build-
ings should be situated adjacent to the
outdoor recreation areas.

0 Whenever a school building is de-
signed for community recreation use,
such should be recognized as an im-
portant function of the building and not
merely as incidental or unessential. A
plan of operation should be worked out
so that community use will in no way
interfere with regular school use, but
use of the school by the community
should be made attractive and conve-
nient.

2. As the school authority has the
final responsibility for planning the
building, the recreation authority shall
share in the responsibility of planning
the grounds, such plans being subject to
the approval of the school authorities:
0 The grounds shall be planned to mu-
tually serve both authorities.

0 The initial develoPment of the play-
ground shall consist of the following
improvements, namely:

1. Grading, leveling, top soil, sod-
ding.

2. Water System—The water system
should be designed to operate a suffi-
cient number of sprinklers so a mini-
mum number of manhours are needed
to water the grounds.

3. Backstops for softball—Softball
backstops should be designed to meet

the needs of both agencies.

4. Hard-surface playslab—The hard-
surface playslab should be of such char-
acter and size as is suitable to the need
of the community.

5. Volleyball standards.

0 The facilities to be added by the rec-
reation authority as the need arises shall
consist of the following:

1. Play apparatus—The playground
apparatus shall consist of swings, mer-
ry-go-round, climbing bars, horizontal
bars, slides, and other approved equip:

SEPTEMBER, 1963

ment.
2. Outdoor stage.
3. Outdoor storage building.
4. F loodlights.
5. Tennis courts.
6. Wading or junior swimming pool.

Financing
The initial development costs of the

area and the costs of the clear areas to
be used for the playground shall be
based on the ratio of the period of time
in major usage by each agency. Under
the present plan this ratio is nine
months for school use and three months
for recreation use. Therefore, the city
will reimburse the school district in the
amount of a quarter of the cost of the
free play area and the improvements
thereon and adjacent thereto.

It is anticipated that the acquisition
of new elementary-school sites and de-
ve10pment will usually be accomplished
before the neighborhood can justify a
playground Operation. The city will pay
its pr0portioned share of the cost of the
land and the basic development costs
when the area develops sufficiently for
a neighborhood recreation program and
such program is put into Operation.

Policies
1. CUSTODIAN SERVICES:

0 A school custodian shall attend all
buildings used by the recreation au-
thority when more than a specific part
of the building is open to the partici-
pants. Example: When the playroom at
a school is in use for a dance and the
hallways of the building must be Open
for the use of the restrooms.

:- A school custodian will not be re-
quired to be present when a specific part
of the school building is in isolated use
as part of a playground Operation; for
cxample, where the playground opera-
tion will include the use of restrooms,
and playroom, with all other parts of
the building closed off.

0 When the recreation program is in
progress and the custodian is still on
school time, there shall be no charge to
the recreation authority.

0 The custodian will be paid at the
hourly rate agreed upon annually.

0 The custodian will be paid a mini-
mum fixed rate for the first two hours
or fractional part thereof where he is
required to return to the building.

0 Time of services shall begin at the
time of opening the buildings and ex-

tend a sufficient period of time beyond
the close of the activity to allow for
cleaning up for the following day. Open-
ing and closing hours shall be Specifi-

cally agreed upon before services are
rendered.

0 When a sustained recreation pro-
gram is in progress at a school for four
to five nights per week throughout the
school year, it may be necessary to hire
a part-time custodian. A straight
monthly rate of pay shall be agreed
upon by both authorities.

0 When the school authority uses a rec-
reation building, the custodian will be
paid an hourly wage agreed upon, un-
less the custodian is still on the recrea-
tion authority’s time.

2. BUILDING MAINTENANCE. The
maintenance and repair of the school
buildings shall be assumed by the school
authority, except when damage to the
building is unusual and is a result of the
recreation program.

3. UTILITIES. To compensate the
school authority for electricity and
water consumed by the city authority in
the use of school facilities throughout
each year, the city will hear each year
all of the school authority’s utility bills
scheduled for billing in the ordinary
course of business during the months
of July and August. .The utility costs
borne by the city thereby will cover part
of the total school utility usage in June,
all of the usage in July, and part of the
usage in August. The heat is to be
furnished by the school.

4. GROUNDSKEEPERS. On the school

playground jointly operated:
o The watering of those parts of the
school playground used for the recrea-
tion program will be done by the rec-
reation authority. .
o The mowing of the grass at the school
playground areas jointly operated by
the two authorities will be done hy the
city. However, the trimming, watering,
and hand mowing of the area immedi-
ately adjacent to the school building
shall be done by the school authority.

Program
1. When the use of a given facility is

permitted one authority, the other au-

thority shall not permit an interference
with the program, unless such inter-
ference is that for which the facility was
primarily designed and constructed.

RESEARCH BRIEFS

Behind the Times

EW YORK CITY’s vast system of public and voluntary
N recreation services is mal-distributed and not attuned to
the needs of residents in its changing neighborhoods, ac-
cording to a study report issued by the Community Council
of Greater New York, the coordinating and planning organi-
zation for health and welfare. A number of New York
neighborhoods urgently in need of recreation services are
poorly served as the result of the uneven distribution of
community supported recreation activities. The study
identifies six neighborhoods which, compared to the rest of
the city, are in greatest need of additional services.

The study finds that recreation acreage and services are
concentrated in a few areas of the city. Nine of the seventy-
four neighborhoods that make up the city contain fifty-three
percent of total park and recreation acreage, while forty-
five of the seventy-four neighborhoods have only ten per-
cent of total recreation acreage.

Indoor full-time recreation centers are concentrated in
Manhattan, which has 122 centers; while Brooklyn has 86
centers; the Bronx, 52; Queens, 33; and Richmond (Staten
Island), 11. There is one full-time center for every fourteen
thousand pe0ple in Manhattan compared to only one center
for every fifty-five thousand people in Queens.

The study shows that the distribution of recreation serv-
ices in the city has lagged behind changes in population
composition of New York neighborhoods. It notes that
minority group and low-income residents are no longer con-
centrated in a few areas which were historically the first
settlements for migrants and immigrants, and where recrea-
tion services were traditionally sponsored by voluntary
agencies. It calls for further extension of services heyond
the island of Manhattan.

The two-year study, Comparative Recreation Needs and
Services in New Y ork Neighborhoods, was undertaken by
the Community Council to identify and call attention to un-
met needs, in order to facilitate the planning and coordina-
tion of recreation, and to provide an optimum distribution
of available services. It is the first study of its kind. In
surveying the seventy-four neighhorhoods of the city, data
were collected on a total of 851 playgrounds; 734 part-time
public centers; 5,561 Boy Scout, Girl Scout, and Camp Fire
Girl groups; and 304 full-time operations, of which 183 were
under voluntary auspices and 121 under puhlic sponsorship.
The study covers four main recreation categories: play-
grounds; part-time, public, after school and evening com-
munity centers; and full-time operations of voluntary agen-
cies, settlement houses, and public centers.

Three factors were assumed to be associated with need
for recreation services. These are income, as a criterion of
need for community suhsidy; juvcnile delinquency, as a
measure of social disorganization; and changes in ethnic
composition of neighborhoods between 1950 and 1960.
Based on these factors, a neighborhood index of socio-eco-
nomic conditions was established. Indexes of existing facili-
ties, participation and leadership were also established for
each neighborhood. When the index of socio-economic con-
ditions is related to the indexes of service, there is a basis
for estimating comparative need among the sevcnty-four
neighborhoods. Two aSpects of services, covered hy the
study but not included among the indexes primarily hecause
there was no way to rank them from “best to worst” or
“most to least” are the kinds of activities participated in,
and the ethnic composition of groups served.

Thirty one neighhorhoods were found to be “integrated”
to the extent that no one ethnic group comprises ninety per-

324

cent or more of residents. These contained a combined
population in which white residents comprise sixty-one per-
cent of total population; Negro and other non-white resi-
dents, twenty-three percent; and Puerto-Bican residents,
sixteen percent. White residents in these neighborhoods
participate largely in scouting programs and voluntary
agency programs. Negro and Puerto Rican residents are
proportionately greater users of public, full-time centers.
There is also heavy use by Negro residents of part-time
public centers. Puerto Rican youth comprise a relatively
large proportion of attendance at part-time, after-school
centers, but a lower proportion at part-time evening centers.

The study calls attention to the complex pattern of spon-
sorship of recreation activities by innumerable public and
voluntary agencies supported by a mixture in many cases
of private funds and governmental funds. A byproduct of
this situation is that statistical reporting and record keeping
in these hundreds of operations vary widely and indicates
need for a more uniform system of reporting and record
keeping.

Membership of all neighborhood full-time recreation
agencies is 303,500 persons, or just under four percent of
total pepulation. Scouting programs serve fourteen percent
of all children from six to fourteen or 128,566 boys and
girls. While no standard exists for the number of people
who should be served, the study calls present services “small
in relation to total population.” It also found that some
recreation centers close on holidays, evenings, weekends,
and during Christmas and Easter week and deplores this

practice as a serious limitation of agency ability to meet
leisure-time needs.

In reporting on unmet community needs, eighty percent
of the agency directors surveyed cited need for additional
facilities, and fifty-five percent for expanded programs.
Third on their list was additional staff. They described the
aged as the major unserved group, followed by teenagers,
with special needs of various ethnic groups also noted.
Among the activities agencies most frequently mentioned
a priority need for enriched cultural programs for teenagers.
They reported a shortage of well-qualified leaders, especially
those trained to work with the aged and with teenagers.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund provided a grant of $40,-
000 toward survey expenses, and the New York City Hous-
ing Authority and the city’s Youth Board also participated
in the financing hy contributing a research assistant each.

Not Enough

CRITICA-I. EVALUATION of the recreation facilities and
A leadership available to the citizens of Indiana’s ninety-
two counties made by the Blue Print Committee for the Gov-
ernor’s Committee on Iiccrcation shows that the facilities
for organized recreation in Indiana hoth outdoor and in-
door are inadequate in most counties to meet the needs of
an expanding population. They do not meet National liec-
reation Association standards for puhlic facilities or the
needs of the semi-puhlic voluntary-supported agencies. The
state parks and recreation facilities, while being developed,
are not adequate to meet the growing leisure-time require-
ments of peeple in Indiana or for visitors from other states.
Family camping facilities are particularly in short supply.
Many communities in the state are not making adequate use
of the facilities they have for organized community recrea-
tion; particularly, public schools and libraries.

Outdoor facilities for park and recreation areas in some
parts of the state and around some of the larger pepulation

RECREATION

centers are rapidly disappearing or are not being developed.
Entrance fees for state park facilities were considered too
expensive for many people and organized groups for use
daily during the summer. The organized group camps oper-
ated by youth-serving agencies, churches, schools, and pri-
vate agencies total less than a third of the number of camps
needed if the American Camping Association standards are
to be reached.

The commercial facilities for recreation and those of the
private membership organizations are growing and develop-
ing faster than public facilities and voluntary supported
semi—public facilities. The only commercial recreation fa-
cility found in every county in the state is a tavern. Moving-
picture theatres, either outdoor or indoor, were found in all
but six counties of the state. Commercial bowling alleys
were increasing in development in many counties and bil-
liard parlors decreasing.

Active Use

HY D0 pe0ple visit Florida’s state parks? This was one
W of the questions asked by the Florida Park Service in
a recent visitor survey. Patrons at nearly all of Florida’s
parks and many of its historic memorials were given ques-
tionnaire forms and asked to complete them at their leisure.
Nearly twenty-one hundred forms were filled in and re-
turned. The vote was conclusive: Florida’s state parks are
the havens for harried city dwellers who want to get away
from it all and enjoy the unspoiled beauty of these natural
areas. More than forty-four percent of the visitors indicated
they visited the parks for picnic outings. Driving through
the park and taking some of the park tours were enjoyed
by 33.8 percent of those questioned. Hiking is not a lost
art after all since more than a third indicated they enjoyed
walking along the nature trails of the parks. Another
twenty percent took part in nature study while in the parks.

Various activities were also enjoyed by these guests.
Swimming was the choice of nearly fourteen percent while
fishing commanded the attention of 13.2 percent. Overnight
campers represented 13.1 percent of the total. Other ac—
tivities were as follows: boating, 4.7 percent; water skiing,
5 percent; and vacation cabins, 2 percent.

The total number of visitors represented by the twenty-
one hundred questionnaires was 12,461; out-of-state visitors
amounted to 14.6 percent or 1,817 of the persons questioned.
Florida residents are, by far, the most active users of their
parks.

Over ninety-seven percent said they had bcen treated
courteonsly, and approval of the cleanliness of buildings and
facilities was given in 96.4 percent of the replies.

Changeover

HAT HAPPENS when a town has lost one of its two re-
W maining iron ore mines and over the past decade has
seen fifteen percent of its population move away because of a
changeover in the iron ore industry? The town of Ely,
Minnesota, is attempting to turn an isolated location into
an asset and convert from a mining town into an attractive
resort community that may become one of the foremost
family vacation headquarters in North America. Located
at the major entrance to the Quetico-Superior region, Ely is
already the primc service center for the world’s largest and
only exclusive canoe country.

After two years of research and planning, the Ely Plan-
ning Commission has adopted a Guide Plan For Community
Development. One of the main features of the plan is a pro-
posed conversion of a caved-in mine area to a protected
boat basin providing a recreation development that includes
camping and picnic grounds, a convention center, historical
exhibits, and a research park for forestry and water-related
sport equipment. The plan has been prepared at the time
of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Ely and provides a chal-

Sixteen Reservoirs

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN for developing and conserving
A the Potomac River’s water and land resources includes
a recommendation that sixteen reservoirs be constructed on
the larger streams in the Potomac Basin. The Potomac River
Basin. Report was issued by the U.S. Army Engineer district
office in Baltimore. The first nine impoundments are needed
now to meet the basin’s present water requirements. How-
ever, to produce a construction timetable that is reasonable
and practicable, these nine reservoirs are scheduled in the
plan on the basis of the comparative seriousness of local
problems. The ninth project would be completed by 1977.
Construction of the remaining seven reservoirs is scheduled
to meet water needs as they develop after 1977.

When combined with 418 headwater impoundments, three
local Hood protection projects, improved treatment of waste
materials, and measures for land management, the sixteen
reservoirs will:

0 Provide generally for all water supply and water quality
control needs to the year 2010.

0 Reduce flood damages by about sixty-three percent.

0 Provide recreation opportunities for as many as 16,000,-
000 visitor-days per year.

In addition, the flow of the Potomac at Great Falls, which
is almost uncontrolled at present, would be regulated to
provide a dependable flow equal to forty-two percent of the
average annual runoff by 2010. Costs for the sixteen major
reservoirs are estimated at $393,341,000, of which $63,782,-
000 would be reimbursed by non—federal agencies and or-
ganizations. The recommendations for each reservoir spe-
cifically cover the potentials for canoeing, boating, picnick-
ing, swimming, hiking, fishing, and wildlife management.

SCIENCE-ORIENTED Vacation Bi-
A ble School in the town of Cape

May Court House, New Jersey,
provides an absorbing program for the
children of the community. The school’s
technical recreation program in its ac-
tivity period proves that science, reli-
gion, and play can advance together.
While the V35 is sponsored alternately
by the local Baptist and Methodist
churches, it is opcn to all children re-
gardless of religious persuasion. Lead-
ership is voluntary and all materials are
donated by local industries, utility com-
panies, and business concerns. The pro-
gram includes many projects for chil-
dren of elementary-school age, six to
thirteen. Daily attendance is over one
hundred.

Each child is supplied materials to
build his own simple light circuits——
an electro magnet—that eventually be-
comes a buzzer Operated on a bread

capacitance and others an iron bar in-
side the coil to tune by inductance. It
is also shown that for a given station
frequency a coil can be wound that does
not need to be tuned. Its internal ca-
pacitance and inductance matches the
station’s frequency and gives good re-
ception with only the diode and antenna
of proper length and direction.

All thc children have the opportunity
to make wave forms of several types and
various frequencies using ropes at-
tached to the floor or the wall. The vis-
ual eflect of wave dampening and en-
ergy levcls are also demonstrated. From
this, the children can understand why
the local radio station can only be heard
about fifty milcs away and does not in-
terfere with stations on the same frc-
quency and power two hundred miles
away.

Wave actions are also seen on an os-
cilloscope. The convcrtcd electrical im-
age of the voice is seen on this oscillo-
scope whcn thc children speak into a
microphone. Also, thc waves of energy
pulses that make up the dots and dashes
of radio code make an interesting and
enlightening display.

OF WONDER

A strobe light shows how pulsing
light can be synchronized to stop a
moving object like a spinning disc or
drops of milk. The various harmonics
are shown and their eflects on the im-
age or images seen. The milk flowing
out of a tube in a steady stream at the
valve and changing to drops is an atten-
tion-getter.

A table of optical equipment of basic
Icns types and prisms attracts consider-
ablc interest. The six-inch prisms are
the most fascinating. Non-magnifying
flat and curved lcnses are made avail-
able. 0thcr lenses for positive and neg-
ative magnification and a cylindcr-type
Icns readily uncover thc mysteries of
optics.

A BIOLOGY TABLE with a small micro-
scope and two fifty-power-projec-
tion scopes is available for magnifica-
tion of insects, ccll structure, other ob-
jects and life in thc unseen world around

Cellotex and divided into three groups
—crawling, walking, or flying. This
can be an excellent after-school activity.

One group concentrated on a rock
collection that stirred interest in others
as the area is mostly sand, and rocks
are believed to be rare. Rocks and
stones from the shores of the Dela-
ware Bay are surprisingly numerous,
however. Considerable rocks of differ-
ent types have also been imported into
the area for uses varying from j etties to
rock gardens, and for pickup souvenirs
for travelers.

TWO TABLES are set up for magnets,
and the children find out for them-
selves that unlike poles attract and like
repel. Hard steel and soft steel bars
(needles and pins) are used to show
retention of magnetism; also material
from TV tubes, such as permanent mag-
nets and ceramic materials that could
be picked up with a magnet but could
not be magnetized.

A six-inch bar magnet is placed
through a six-inch globe (world) so that
magnetic compass direction and effect
on the compass can readily be seen. The
fact that a compass needle can be mag-
netized to point south instead of north
causes the practical joker to laugh and
the more serious-minded to shudder at
the consequences—be it in the woods
or at sea.

Electromagnets make use of #26
wire on an eight-penny nail. Experience
soon shows that a good neat winding
job makes the best magnet. The lifting
power even with a single flashlight ccll
is amazing; to shut off the power to
drop the load is intriguing (no visible
energy, or glue, or little claws). The
heating up of the battery being dis-
charged and coils being energized are
the only clues to the action. It is ex-
plained that the heat does not do the
work; that the heat is a result of the en-
ergy being released——chemical energy
converting to electrical energy.

The rule of the left hand is demon-
strated and tried by many of the boys
and girls. This is a single strand of
#28 wire stretched between two nails
connected to a single flashlight battery.
The left hand is placed under the wire
with the thumb pointing in the direction
of the current. The fingers curve around

the w1re indicatmg the direction of the
magnetic field. A small (north-seeking)
compass placed over or under the wire
verifies the theory.

The magnetic field through a coil is
shown by a single loop of wire in a ver-
tical plain using the same small com-
pass. A coil of many turns has the same
effect but produces a stronger field.
This same coil is used with two mag-
netized needles to show how they can
be made to repel each other and yet re-
main near the center of the coil. The
needles have small round pieces of cork
on them to act as wheels so that they
roll easily. The corks rest on a piece of
flat plastic giving them a flat level sur-
face to roll. The coil goes through the
plastic in a vertical plane. Varying the
current in the field varies the magnetic
force of the coil so that the needles’
distance from each other varies—but
each remains equal distances from the
center.

The Thompson atom experiment us-
ing a coil around an eight-inch evapora-
tion dish is also set up. This is very
interesting as the number of needles
(dipoles) with cork floats determine
the number of rings formed. Variations
in the electrical current cause almost
immediate changes in the corks (needle
dipoles) position or the diameter of the
rings formed.

A small crank-operated telephone
ringing generator is used for shocking
experiments. This is set up on a board
so that a fuse or bulb (incandescent or
neon) can be used in parallel or in se-
ries with the hand held electrodes. Four
resistors in series, individually tapped,
are also mounted on the board to dem-
onstrate how increasing the resistance
decreases the shock received.

When conducting these experiments,
each group should have an adult to
carry through. The adult does not have
to be experienced, just interested. He
will learn along with the youngsters and
have fun doing it! The children are
free to try, experiment, or watch others
in the activities set up for them.

SCIENCE activity is most important

to the children of today; the world
of science is becoming more and more
their world. Experience is the key to
unlock the door to the future. By see-
ing and doing, they learn and develop

a feeling of deep satisfaction. From
this small, creative experience, the seed
of wonder is planted, a sensitivity to the
wonder of the universe and the Creator
who gave us capabilities measured by
our mental, physical, and spiritual
growth.

There are interesting Bible lessons,
workbooks and handcrafts, group sing-
ing and fine visual-aid programs, all
correlated with these scientific wonders,
and thus playing their parts in the chil-
dren’s spiritual growth. One of the
pegboards with the battery, light, and
switch is used to teach a Bible lesson in
one of the worship programs.

Variations and innovations in sport and
sports equipment attract new participants

WHEEL CHAIR BO WLIN G

GREAT STRIDES have been made by
the Colorado Springs Recreation
Division in developing wheelchair bowl-
ing as a program activity for the handi-
capped. The management of the local
bowling alley has supplied personnel for
instruction, scoring, and many areas of
personal assistance. Storage space is
also made available for the many pieces
of equipment designed and built by the
park and recreation department. Ralnps
for chairs, slides for ball delivery, hand-
rests and pusher cues have become
standard equipment in producing scores
of well over 100, with the high in one
game being 184.

SOCCER AT THE TOP

HEN the recreation department in

Kirkwood, Missouri, was acti-
vated on September 18, 1961, an agree-
ment between the city and the school
board for use of facilities had been
worked out and a slender budget
ad0pted. Some skepticism of the need
for the innovation of the department
was evident among residents. Fall was
coming quickly, thus limiting the selec-
tion of active outdoor sports. A quick
survey of area preferences almost im-
mediately put the “finger” on soccer.

into a single round arrangement fol-
lowed by a singles and doubles tourna-
ment. All of this is on a handicap scor-
ing basis to even out many discrepancies
in ability. Fortunately, one person in
the group had had experience in wheel-
chair bowling and was very helpful dur-
ing the experimental period. Her will-
ingness to act as league secretary proved
a stabilizing influence. In addition, a
host of volunteers and organizations are
earnestly assisting rccreation division
personnel in making this wheelchair
sport a challenging experience for par-
ticipants and all concerned—E. S.
RICHTER, Assistant Director, Park and
Recreation Department, Colorado
Springs, Colorado.

This sport enjoys wide popularity in the
Midwest. It involves liinitless numbers
of boys and, with the playing fields
available, it appeared to be the answer.

In the interest of eXplaining functions
of the new department to as many resi-
dents as possible, its recreation director,
Mrs. Permelia Dunn, embarked on an
extensive speaking tour to service clubs
and churches; in short, to any com-
munity assembly that would extend an
invitation. Her persuasive enthusiasm

resulted in the Noonday Optimist Club

meet special needs and limitations.
Here is a sampling of such programs
which promote fitness, fan, and festivity.

served and the publicity went out. Re-

P0 T -BELLIED BASKETBALL

THE RECREATION DEPARTMENT in Pe-

kin, Illinois, endeavors to provide
activities for the middle-aged man. First
it conducted a fathers’ slow-pitch soft-
ball tournament, which was accepted
with so much enthusiasm that thought
was given to offering some other activ-
ity for the winter program. Basketball
came to mind—but what to call it?
Well, consider the type of men involved
and you know why “pot-bellied basket-
ball” was a natural.

Notices of an impending tournament
were sent to the local newspaper, radio,
and TV stations. Hoping against hope
to get at least four teams, the depart-
ment was overwhelmed when twelve
teams wanted to enter. The teams en-
rolled were from local business estab-
lishments, local clubs, and local men in-
terested in basketball. Unfortunately,
time and money did not allow using all
twelve teams. The most that could be
handled were eight teams, using a dou-
ble elimination tournament. This tour-
ney ran five nights with three games
each night.

A tournament can be set up with a
very limited amount of equipment:

0 Three or four basketballs.

four weeks of intensive training. The
boys lined up their own rosters of six-
teen players at $1 each, selected their
captains and their own imaginative
team names. Enthusiasm was as great
at the end of the season as at the begin-
ning; in fact, the boys pleaded to be
allowed to play even when games were
cancelled because of icy or soggy fields.

Thus, at least five hundred families
of this city of thirty thousand residents
were made immediately conscious of the
new department and advantages of or-
ganized recreation. “Soccer was a hap-
py choice,” says Mrs. Dunn. “It offers
boys an outside activity during winter
months when the horizon of active
sports is limited. The most rewarding
part of the program is that it gives op-
portunity to boys to feel the security of

o Scorebooks.

o Officials—two qualified referees,

o Ribbons or trophies.

! Rosters were limited to eighteen men
per team and team rosters were used
instead of individual contracts to facili-
tate handling of the tournament. Each
team member was required to sign a
waiver slip, releasing all sponsoring
agencies concerned from any or all in-
juries sustained during the tournament.

Pot-bellied basketball is played like
any other basketball game with the fol-
lowing exceptions:

0 Depending upon the size of the floor

( see facilities), five men are on the
court at all times. One man will stay
in defensive court, and one will be sta-
tioned in the offensive court. These
men are stationed for each half quarter
and are not allowed to cross the center
line at any time during that period. The
other three players may utilize the full
court.

team participation regardless of prow-
ess. Many of our happiest groups are
made up of disappointed lads who failed
to qualify for school teams. They come
to us singly and we find places for them
with the result that a feeling of confi-
dence in their own ability is built up.
Soccer team membership becomes a sta-
tus symbol in the eyes of comrades.”

Once launched, of course, the recrea-
tion programs fanned out in many di-
rections to attract all age groups. “But
the icebreaker was soccer and I can
heartily recommend it to other recrea-
tion departments just beginning or to
others who have not yet introduced it
into their programs,” says Mrs. Dunn.

tions Director, City of Kirkwod, Mis-

o If a defensive or offensive man
should leave his area, a technical foul
is called, and the opposing team shoots
a free throw and gets the ball out of
bounds. If this infraction occurs, it is
the responsibility of the scorer’s table
to notify officials of this violation, as the
official has enough pressure on him just
controlling the ballgame.

0 Because this is a recreation activity,
all team members should participate in
it at least one quarter of each game.
Players may be substituted only during
the one-minute rest periods and during
the time regulation basketball is being
played. An exception to this would be
in case of injury or a team member foul-
ing out of the game.

0 Five fouls are allotted each team
member.

Facilities play a major part in deter-

mining participating players on a team;
therefore, note the following sugges-

1' GROWING INTEREST in golf shown

by women in Concord, New Hamp-
shire, led the recreation and parks de-
partment to organize a Thursday morn-
ing Housewives Golfing League. Most
of the women had never had a club in
their hands before; some had taken
spring lessons indoors given by the
municipal pro, Chct Wheeler, for a
small fee. Now, when the snow disap-
pears, the women are invited to meet
each Thursday at 9 A.M. 011 the city
links and try their skills at the various
games set up. Each woman participat-
ing pays a quarter to the kitty which is
split up among the winners and some-
times the losers. In order to keep new
players from being discouraged, a va-
riety of games are used in which the
poor golfer has a chance to win as well
as the par golfer.

An attempt is made to put a good
golfer in each foursome set up, to give
pointers on rules and etiquette and what
might be wrong with stance, and swing.
Informal instruction not only helps the
learner, but the teacher finds she had

Pot-bellied basketball fills a need in
our community. Not only is there much
enthusiasm for the tournament, but it
also does the men good to get back into
the limelight as participants instead of
spectators. This year the recreation de-
partment will not only conduct the pot-
bellied basketball tournament, but will
turn it into a league in order to satisfy
all the men who were unable to par-
ticipate last year.—RICHARD BUERKLE,
Superintendent of Recreation, Play-
ground and Recreation Board, Pekin,

bctter practice what she preachcs. The
women count each and every stroke
whether they whiff or dub the ball as
only in this way can they tell if they are
improving.

The biggest problem with the begin-
ners in golf is not to let them get dis-
couraged. Fun games instead of league
competition should he used until they
get to a point where every swing at the
ball is a whiff or dub shot. The favorite
of the Concord Housewives League, and
the best starting game for this kind of
a group, is “Scramhle.” A description
of many games of this type is available
free from the United States Golf Asso-
ciation Journal, 40 East 38th Street,
New York 16. The National Golf Foun-
dation, 407 Dcarborn Street, Chicago,

tains over one hundred different tourna-
ment events—BETTY ABBOTT, Recrea-

131 FOR THE ILL 6’9? HANDICAPPED

 

+ An unusual Institute on Day-Camp-
ing for the Mentally Retarded was held
at Southern Illinois University May 19-
25. Cosponsored by Southern Illinois
University and the Joseph P. Kennedy,
Jr. Foundation, the institute was con-
ducted on camp property owned by the
university at Carbondale. The program
was designed as a general orientation
program for recreation personnel en-
gaged in day-camp operation for the
mentally retarded. Thirty-three train-
ees, carefully selected to participate in
eleven day-camp operations scattered
throughout the United States, were pro-
vided with a concentration of theory,
demonstration, and practice given by a
group of experts and consultants espe-
cially invited for this purpose.

Groups of retarded children were
brought in daily to participate in the
demonstration phases of the institute
which included sports and games, crafts,
swimming and watcr safety, boating,
horseback riding, music and folk dance,
and nature study. 011 May 24th the
trainees took over the leadership role in
working with the retarded children.

All of the program materials and
speeches are to be compiled into a man-
ual, Day Camp Operation for the Men-
tally Retarded. Much of the program
was filmed and it is hoped the product
will develop into an excellent training
film.

Included among the institute’s speak-
ers were R. Sargent Shriver, director,
Peace Corps, Washington, D.C.; Mrs.
Eunice Shriver, executive vice-presi-
dent, Joseph P; Kennedy, Jr. Founda-
tion; Milo F. Christensen, superintend-

The project will involve the referral
of one hundred arthritics from the Phil-

Foundation through the Philadelphia
Recreation Department into various
recreation centers and other agency
centers where each case will be included
in ongoing recreation programs in the
community. Attention will be paid to
individual needs and each case will be
observed and evaluated for physical
improvement, program participation
and socialization. It is anticipated that
this medically oriented recreation proj-

RUTH W. STEVENS

OMANCE thrilled the youthful so-
R prano, her blond ponytail and

pink rufiles trembling in rapport.
Standing alone before the mike (thank
goodness for modern amplifiers), she
was deliciously aware that all eyes (and
most ears) in the city park were turned
her way. Behind her, the shirt-sleeved
members of our town band were sweat-
ing out a draggy accompaniment, while
their rotund leader Hailed his arms like
a windmill and besought his musicians
quite audibly to “pick it up.” Before
her, the considerable, casually dressed
audience relaxed under the stars and
the high swaying elms and loved every
minute of it. So did I.

With a musical heritage like mine,
this was understandable. I had been
raised on weekly summer evening con-
certs in this same little city park, in Ot-
tumwa, Iowa. In winter, more ambi-
tious programs were presented inside
our splendiferous Grand Opera House,
complete with white bearskin-draped
podium, natty uniforms, and assorted
sound effects. So, many years later,
how heartwarming to realize that this
truly American tradition, the al fresco
band concert, was still very much alive!

The wonderful custom of town band
music making began in New England
and reached its peak in the middle eigh-
ties. Their town greens were ideal set-

a well-known contributor to national
magazines and a resident of Ottumwa,
Iowa. Her father, the late Professor B.

tings and their summers mild. Then, as
now, most of the musicians had to make
their living at other trades, but music
was their hobby. The mechanical im-
provements were made in the instru-
ments, the makeup of the band remained
about the same, brasses predominating
followed by reeds and drums. Since the
Civil War people have liked that instru-
mentation and still do. Lethargic in-
deed is the individual who does not re-
spond to a rousing march tune played
on shiny horns.

The heyday of the lucrative and im-
mensely popular concert bands playing
in the great amusement parks roughly
spanned the years between 1875 and
1925. Small towns no longer could af-
ford these tremendous attractions, but
transportation companies, who mostly
owned the parks, found them a veritable
gold mine. Their steam trains, inter-
urbans, and ferry boats carried thou-
sands to these famous parks and seaside
resorts. The customers were more than
happy to pay handsome fees to see dra-
matic conducting and splendid musi-
cianship.

Patrick S. Gilmore was the first of
these showmen supreme, presenting
mass festivals which featured the best
bands and singers of Europe and Amer-
ica. Underneath his extravagant dis-
plays Gilmore was a solid musician.
John Philip Sousa, his worthy succes-
sor, fared equally well with a sure-fire
formula of high musical standards, deft
showmanship, and his own matchless
marches.

These rich years petered out finally
with the coming of radio, the phono-
graph and rapid private transportation.

With the passing of the huge amusement
parks, the concert bands were deprived
of both audience and revenue. The final
blow was the rise of the American jazz
band.

But the small (and sometimes not so
small) town band refused to accept its
death knell and happily the people
would not let it. It is impossible to list
all the fine bands still regularly per-
forming. One especially impressive
record is that of the Allentown, Penn-
sylvania, band which has a continuous
record of performance since 1828. The
Goldman Band of New York City has
played for over forty years and is still
going strong. The approximately two
hundred US. service bands are richly
endowed and give dazzling pcrform-
ances.

But to return to Iowa, where we en-
joy more free outdoor band concerts
than any other state, and audiences
grow in size every year. They are re-
warded by hearing such organizations
as the Ft. Dodge Municipal Band, led
by the eminent Karl King, the “March
King.” Iowa has a unique law which
guarantees that the state will pay a cer-
tain percent of what the municipality
levies as a band tax. Here in Ottumwa,
the band tax levy is approximately one-
quarter of a mill for 1962.

A comparatively recent development
in most small towns are the concerts
given by high-school bands. These have
the blessing of labor, parents and teach-
ers. Our college and university bands
are in a different class, of course, with
remarkably proficient performances.

I do not suppose that out here in Iowa
or anywhere else for that matter, there
is danger we will ever become too cul-
tural. I would hate to see the time come
when the band concert in the park, and
evening’s get-together of friends and
neighbors for pleasurable listening,
fades from the summer scene. #1}:

A REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK

 

Space Exploration

A spacemobile toured playground
and park areas in Westchester County,
New York, this summer with a lecture
demonstration program. This was part
of the summer services offered local rec-
reation departments by the County of
Westchester Department of Parks, Rec-
reation, and Conservation. The space-
mobile program was deveIOped by the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration and the models and equip-
ment are carried on a specially adapted
panel truck.

The spacemobile delves into the
meaning and sc0pe of space by means
of words, models, and science experi-
ment demonstrations. The laws of mo-
tion are simply explained and the prin-
ciple of a reaction motor demonstrated.
Simple experiments are performed il-
lustrating solid and liquid types of
rocket fuels. Space programs discussed
included Project Mercury for orbiting
a manned spacecraft; Project Gemini,
for orhiting a two-man spacecraft and
deve10ping techniques for oining craft
in orbit; Project Apollo for landing an
explorer team on the moon and return-
ing the team safely to earth; Ranger,
Surveyor, and Prospector, a‘ll unman-
ned spacecraft for moon exploration:
Mariner and Voyager, spacecraft for
unmanned exploration of other planets.
Other explanations and demonstrations
covered Tiros, Nimbus, and Aeros,
weather satellite programs; Echo, Re-
bound, Relay, Telstar, and Syncom,
communication satellites; and orhiting
ge0physical, solar, and astronomical oh-
servatories designed for study of the

universe and of earth’s space environ-
ment.

The Last Mile

A little red caboose has joined the
steam locomotive in Cincinnati’s Land
of Make Believe at the Airport Play-
ground. The caboose was presented to
the recreation commission hy the Rail-
road Community Committee of Greater
Cincinnati, an organization made up of
representatives of the five railroads
serving the area. The little cahoose be-

334

longed to the Norfolk 8: Western and for
forty years was used on the Cincinnati-
to-Norfolk run. It is now retired to the
playfield where youngsters are ahle to
board it and examine its fascinating in-
terior. The Land of Make Believe now
includes a steam locomotive, two fire
engines, a jet plane, a stagecoach, and
an antique police patrol.

Pressure at Work

Higher pay, more leisure, and the
population “explosion” are putting so
much pressure on California’s wildlands
that there is a critical need for more
knowledge of how to handle these lands,
according to Dr. R. Merton Love, chair-
man of the department of agronomy at
the University of California at Davis.
The agronomist says there is competi-
tion and sometimes conflict hctween
groups that want rangelands to he used
for differing purposes, such as recrea-
tion, lumbering, watersheds, and live-
stock ranges.

Dr. Love warns. “Unless the search
for knowledge is cxpanded promptly
and substantially, deficiencies in basic
research information will soon be criti-
cal. Outdoor recreation in California in

1958 totaled 235,000,000 activity-days.

 

0,6 lirnits to adults. In Jacksonville,
Florida, Carol Williams and Sarah

Anne Mallison were co-chairmen of an
art show by and for youngsters at Twin
Hills Civic Center. No adults were al»
lowed, there were no entry fees, pre-
judging, nor prizes. The youngsters cat-
alogued the exhibits, prepared refresh-
ments, hung paintings, made displays
of craftwork, arranged flowers and pot-
ted plants, then acted as hosts and
hostesses.

By the year 2000, recreation will have
increased four times within the commu-
nity, sixteen times in urban and week-
end zones—and forty times in vacation
or resource zones.”

They Shall Have Trees

The planting of a spruce tree, the
21,000th tree in the spring planting
program in Montreal parks, highlighted
the city’s eleventh observance of Arbor
Day. The ceremony, as in previous
years, formed part of the Beautification
Week program in May. A feature of the
day was distribution of ten thousand
young trees to school children of the
city for planting in appropriate places.
Joseph Dumont, superintendent of the
Montreal Parks Department forestry di-
vision, spoke during the ceremonies and
asked, “Can you imagine a city without
a tree? Would it not be, to take the
wonderful words of Victor Hugo, like a
hive without bees? A cage without
birds? A house without children?”

Museum Mansions

Little Rhode Island, smallest of the
fifty states, can probahly hoast more
“museum mansions” for its area (48-
by-37 milcs) than any other state in the
union. What is a “museum mansion”?
It is a former private home which, be-
cause of its historic value and archi-
tectural significance, has been preserved
for current and future generations, and
which is open to the public on a rcgular
or semi-regular basis. Both Providence
and Newport ahound in such museum
mansions; others are scattered through-
out the state in other communities. All
are a living record of the history of the
United States from its earliest begin-
nings.

Most recently Opened “museum man-
sion” is “The Elms,” magnificent New-
port estate of the late E. J. Berwind,
Philadelphia coal magnate. Purchased
in July 1962, hy the Preservation So-
ciety of NewPort County, the estate is
largely modelled after the Chateau
d’Asnieres near Paris. The interior has

RECREATION

been refurnished in keeping with its era
and style by loans from museums and
private collections; its magnificent
gardens, featuring bronze and marble
statues and fountains, have also been
.restored. Trees and hedges in the park
or gardens are carefully shaped in the
French manner, as probably originally
conceived by landscape artist Jacques
Greber. Special evening openings are
planned for the gardens only, with
lights, fountains, and background
music, during July, August, and Sep-
tember.

3“ Starred items indicate an exhibitor at the 45th National
Recreation Congress ( see also Pages 310-11). Congress
booth number is given at end of item.

0 Cutting corners. Toro’s new 25-inch Hevi-Duty Whirl-
wind rotary-power mower, powered by a four-cycle, 51/2HP
engine, is designed to meet the grass maintenance needs of
parks, golf courses, recreation areas, and other large in-
stallations. The 25-inch Whirlwind is especially effective in
the South, where tough and wiry warm-weather grasses’
(Bermuda and St. Augustine) and winter rye place heavy
demands on power mowers. Spongy or sandy ground pre-
sents no problems for the new Toro mower because of its
large (20”-by-1%”) rear wheels. The mower also features
Toro’s exclusive Wind-Tunnel design which assures more
efficient cutting even under the most adverse conditions.
The W ind-Tunnel allows grass clippings to be discharged
uniformly instead of in clumps. With an optional bagging
kit, the steady stream of air which flows through the housing
can be utilized to vacuum and bag grass clippings, leaves,
and other lawn debris. A large, six-quart fuel tank—located
on the handle for betterweight distribution and accessibility
—keeps the unit running for a full four hours. Five different
front-wheel height adjustments—front one inch to three and
a half inches—are possible with the 25-inch Whirlwind. A
sixth adjustment varies the blade slightly above or below the
horizontal for operation in heavy growth areas. The rear
wheels are also adjustable to maintain a level attitude at all
five cutting heights.
" ' ”' For closer trimming near trees
and walls, Toro’s new 25-inch
Parklawn ofiers high maneuvera-
bility. A front-cutting reel mower,
it clips the grass before the big
drive wheels can pass over and
flatten it. The 31/;HP engine de-
livers speeds up to 4.6 miles per
hour. With steerable sulky, the
Par/dawn becomes a riding unit
with a cutting capacity of an acre
per hour or it doubles as a walking
unit with handbars affixed. It has forward and reverse gear
and separate clutches for reel and traction. Grass-catcher is
optional.

For further information on Toro equipment (including
snow-throwing equipment). write to James Kaufman, Toro
Manufacturing Corporation, 8111 Lyndale Avenue, Min-

neapolis 20, Minnesota. (See also Pages 320-321.)

 

o Tread on me! Thousands of indestructible diamond-hard
abrasive minerals are bonded into every foot of the Super
Stairmaster safety tread. The resulting wearing qualities
surpass that of concrete, stone, marble, and other types of
stair materials, providing a permanent solution to stairway
repair and maintenance. The tread has a heavy-duty base
of heat-treated extruded aluminum. It is nine inches wide
(deep) overall and availablc in any length up to twelve feet
in one piece. Longer lengths are furnished in multiple sec-
tions. Various square-edge and bevel-edge sections can be
used to fill out landing areas where more than a nine-inch
tread is required.

The tread is easily installed over any type of stairway
construction, interior or exterior. The necessary fasteners.
leveling compound for badly worn stairs, and adhesive when

 

required are furnished in a package for quick, easy installa-
tion. Its excellent wearing qualities permit it to be installed
in areas where extreme foot traffic exists. For complete in-
formation, a new brochure illustrating the Aluminum Super
Stairmaster tread is available free from the manufacturer,
Wooster Products Inc., Wooster, Ohio.

0 Mini-in-one. A single self-con-
tained unit called M ini-Gym provides
a complete gamut of fitness exercises
and stunts. Against the wall, out of
the way, it is always available for use
‘ without the necessity for supervision.
Originally designed for United States’
underground minute-men installa-
tions where exercise facilities are
limited, the M ini-Gym combines the
many advantages of stall bars and an
abdominal board, with chest and
floor pulley weights.

The Mini-Gym ladder is sturdily
constructed of oval-shaped steel with
welded tubular steel rungs. Carefully finished in lifetime
chrome, it measures 34”-by-93” high. The abdominal board,
which hooks on the top rung of the ladder when not in use,
is made from three-quarter-inch plywood, padded with one
and a quarter inches of polyethylene foam, and covered with
a blue vinyl-impregnated nylon covering. The heavy-duty
wall-mounted pully weights, with both floor and chest pul-
leys, are furnished with twenty-five pounds of weights. The
amount of weights to be raised is adjustable. Mini-Gym is
easily wall-mounted on four hardwood stringers. For more

information write to the t'issen Corporation, 930-27th Ave-
nue. S.W., Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

3% Time at bat. An entirely different type of batting trainer,
the Place-Hitter set, contains a thirty-inch bat, three regu-
lation-sizc balls, and a sturdy base unit. A tap on the target
area of the flipper with the bat pitches one of the plastic balls
straight up, allowing enough time for a full swing to the
fences or a carefully placed bunt down the foul line. Three
balls may be hit without reloading. Balls are released with-
out awkward foot stomping or uncertain mechanical devices.

Raymond S. Kimbell, general man-
ager of the San Francisco Recreation
and Park Department, during an inter-
view with Joe Allison of the San Fran-
cisco News Call Bulletin, was “blunt
and adamant” about harring any new
encroachment for freeways, parking
lots, or any other reason on any of his
city’s parks. Said Mr. Kimbell, “I
would not myself give up a single square
inch for parking. If the people want to
come to the park, let them park on the
outside and walk in. They could do well
to relearn the joys of walking. And 1
would not give up any ground to per-
mit widening of park roads so traffic
can move faster. Let the people drive
slowly, if they must drive, so they can
cnjoy the beauties of the park.” Mr.
Kimbell is due to retire this year after
thirty-five years with the San Francisco
department.

age of seventeen hundred gallons and
a capacity to heat two thousand gallons
per hour. The kitchen is provided with
a booster heater for dishwashing pur-
poses. The swimming pool, piping and
equipment has a capacity of 150,000
gallons of water.

The pool is filled with water from
two fill lines located under the diving
boards at the deep end of the pool.
These till lines have a physical air break
above the Hood level of the pool com-
pletely protecting them from backflow
or contamination from pool water. The
drain system of the pool is also designed
so that a sewer backup cannot contami-
nate the pool water. The health and
safety of the bather guided the design
of the pool and filtering equipment.

Complete drainage of the exterior
areas and parking facilities has been
accomplished through the utilization of
catch basins and parking area drains.
Drainage facilities have also been pro-
vided for the outdoor sun deck. Out-
side manholes have been located at
changes in direction of the house sewer,
and as a means of easy access for clean-
ing and maintenance of these sewers.

THE CITIZENS who enjoy the use of

this center will always be grateful
to St. Louis philanthropist David P.
Wohl. His portrait, painted by a for-
mer recreation leader, Voris Dickerson,
is displayed in the center’s lobby and
is a tribute to this generous St. Louisan
who helped to make this recreation cen-
ter possible. #

Guide for Joint Use
(Continued from Page 323)

 

Example: If the recreation authority
grants permission to the school author-
ity the use of Downs Field for the An-
derson High School baseball team, then
priority in the scheduling of Downs
Field should be given the Anderson
High School.

2. The school district will not grant
the use of school facilities to any other
individual or group, other than regular-
ly constituted school groups, for prac-
tices or scheduled games or activities
that are not recognized as an organized,

     ereates men and citizens. In The City in History, that mon-

umental book which has won for Lewis Mumford the Na-

America’s National Pastime tional Book Award, the author has some interesting things

to say about the outward aspect of Athens in the classic age

 

Brought to life indoors — with all of Pericles and Plato. The picture we have in our minds, he
the thrills and excitement of the big says, is of a town with “a marmoreal chastity, a purity and
league, As much fun to watch as if rationality.” This did not exist in fact. If the pair's existed

in this form it was afterwards, in the third century B.C.,
when the impetus of the great age had been spent and men

were settling down into an existence no longer fired by ardor
and ereativeness.

The Creek mind at the top of its bent possessed, besides
its love of abstract perfection and its strong inner order,
“the violent, tormented and irrational aspects . . . one finds
in the tragic dramatists or in the rude horseplay and barn-

yard smut one encounters in Aristophanes.” The Greek eity

No one has been more scathing than Mr. Mumford in his
denunciation of modern ugliness; yet Athens, he reminds
us, kept in the period when life was at its highest develop-

below, finding completion as part of the landscape of rock
and blue sky. In this tension between the old and new, be-
tween the perfection of the isolated form on the hill and the
seething city below, between, as it were, earth and sky——

Let us make sure, as we build for ourselves, that men and
their cities prove of equal worth. It is not only bcauty itself
but also the striving for beauty that lifts up men and makes
a civilization. We shall strive in our own way, as this second
half of the century moves toward its meridian. Who shall

say that the striving will not bring its own rewards? #

We SHALL NEVER have a great culture until we de-
velop a passion for wisdom. The Athenians made
an immortal contribution to culture because to them
reason was a way of life and intellectual curiosity was
man’s most important trait. The dramatic performances
were not reserved for the few, but were for all: the

young and the old, the rich and the poor. Art was not
conhned to the museum but was a part of their every-
day living. Philosophy was not a classroom activity.
but an undertaking which excited the alert minds of
Athens and it dealt with problems which have a time-
less significance—FREDERICK MAYER, PhD. in Educa-
tion for Creative Living (Whittier Books).

NEW PUBLICATIONS

 

Elements of Park and Recreation Ad- sition and development, and operative

ministration, Charles E. Doell. Burgess
'ublishing Company, 426 South Sixth
itreet, Minneapolis 15. Pp. 340.$5.50.

Park and recreation literature has
teen enriched by this publication by
. Sharles E. Doell, superintendent emeri-
us of the Minneapolis Park Board. He
ias presented, in compact form, invalu-
able information based on his long
years of experience. He modestly as-
serts in the preface that the book deals
only with certain important elements of
the total subject and he recommends
_more extensive reading from other au-
thors. It will not be easy to find a more
valuable and practical treatment of

many of the topics discussed by Mr.
Doell.

Park and recreation management is
described as an art rather than a science
and its practice therefore rests upon
personal judgments and “upon policies
emanating from tradition, experiences,
popular demand, social evaluation,”
among others. Therefore, all of us need
to keep abreast of changes in environ-
ment, culture, and convention and to
“keep our minds open and our attitudes
inquisitive.”

Following the introductory chapter,
which contains definitions and a brief
history, are four chapters describing
the nature, development, and status of
park systems of the country: city and
suburban, metropolitan and county,
state and federal. The author states
“that by and large there is a distinct
sphere of service for each level of gov-
ernment to perform,” in spite of the

confusing deviations from widely ac-
cepted concepts.

The chapters dealing with specific
aspects of administration are exceed-
ingly practical. The main purpose of
“The Makers of a Park Plan,” for ex-
ample, is “to discourage the makings
of a park plan by an amateur” and the
chapter points out clearly that the crea-
tion of a good, sound, functional, beau-
tiful park design requires c00perative
cffort. “Personnel Organization” con-
tains a description of the functions of
the entire staff and of workers in speci-
fic positions; also a discussion of staff
organization in the department. In
“Budgets” conflicting concepts of their
nature and administration are clarified.

Three chapters dealing with “Poli-
cies” contain a fund of sound advice on
such matters as relationships, site acqui-

SEPTEMBER, 1963

procedures Mr. Doell proposes that de-
viations from the “settled course” in-
dicated by official policies should be
made out with a full determination that
the new way is distinctly better than the
old. The appendix contains a number
of articles, speeches, reports, and notes
that pertain to and supplement the pre-
ceeding material.

It is difficult to find shortcomings in
Mr. Doell’s book except for one of
minor significance. In his discussion of
city planning for parks, he ignores com-
pletely the neighborhood playground as
a unit. He apparently considers it as
identical with the neighborhood park,
since he.refers to the National Recrea-
tion Association’s standard of one acre
for each eight hundred population as
“for neighborhood parks,” whereas the
Association has proposed this amount
for the neighborhood playground and a
different amount for the neighborhood
park. Since the neighborhood play-
ground is widely recognized as a type
of area distinct from the neighborhood
park, the author might well have point-
ed this out even though he felt the two
types should be combined in a single
area.

Elements of Park and Recreation A d-

ministration merits a place in the rec-
reation classroom as well as in the ofiice
of every park and recreation adminis-
trator.—George D. Butler.

The Leisure Age: Its Challenge to
Recreation, Norman P. Miller and
Duane M. Robinson. Wadsworth Pub-

lishing Compony, Belmont, California.
Pp. 5l2. $6.95.

Drs. Miller and Robinson give us an
excellent analysis of the role of leisure
and recreation in the lives of Americans
today. They examine the forces that in-
fluence and interact with recreation,
the various needs of individuals as these
pertain to and can be satisfied by recre-
ation. and the ways people have come
together to organize their leisure and
recreation. They explore the present
status of recreation as a profession and
the philosophy supporting present-day
views. Here are the significant prob-
lems and trends facing the field of rec-
reation and the challenges for the fu-
ture. The book offers some excellent
definitions of common terminology
within the field. It is highly recom-
mended to every recreation profes-
sional, the recreation major, and indi-
viduals considering recreation as a ca-

reer.—Charles E. Hartsoe, Secretary,
National Recreation Congress.

0 Dr. Miller will serve on the panel of
the doy-in-depth symposium on leisure
ot the 45th National Recreation in
Congress in St. Louis. See Page 310.

Shadow Puppets, Olive Blockhom.
Harper and Row, 49 East 33rd Street,
New York 16. Pp. 198, illustroted.
$5.95.

Shadow Puppets, by Olive Blackham,
a leading authority on puppetry in Eng-
land, belongs with The Puppet Theatre
Handbook by Marjorie Batchelder and
Puppets and Plays by Marjorie Batchel-
der and Virginia Lee Comer, leading
US. puppet experts now residing in
Santa Fe, New Mexico. Many recrea-
tion leaders will remember the wonder-
ful demonstrations of these two Ameri-
can puppet experts. These three vol-
umes should be in every recreation li-
brary.

Shadow Puppets is part historical and
part practical. Both parts are beauti-
fully and usefully presented. The ap-
pendices include lists of suitable mate-
rials for shadows, a shadow play with
music, lists of museums with a shadow
puppet collection, both here and abroad,
and a bibliography.—Siebolt Frieswylt.

Interior Art and Decoration. Lone
Book Company, Menlo Park, Colifor-
nio. Pp. 96, illustrated. Paper, $1.75.

The ideas in this magazine-like book
have, to quote the editors, “nothing to
do with style of interior decoration or
the latest colors for curtains or walls.
. . . Each is an example of someone’s
using the space and walls of his home
to express his enthusiasm and his own'
way of living.” The result is page after
page of unusual, creative ideas that
don’t sound too hard for a non-craft
person to try.

These ideas don’t have to be for the
home. Many could be used to make of-
fices and clubrooms more attractive.
Many are fine ideas for displays, ex-
hibits, and other visual materials. It is
a fascinating book for anyone inter-
ested in highlighting his hobby, or dis-
playing kitchen equipment, finding new
ways to decorate for holidays, making
bulletin boards, and room dividers, un-
usual and clever candlesticks, and a host
of other imaginative uses of everyday

materials, simple equipment, and a slim
pocketbook. H

American Indian Arts, Julia M. Seton.
Ranald Press, 15 East 26th Street, New
Yark l0. Pp. 246, illustrated. $6.00.

Julia M. Seton, wife of the late Ernest
Thompson Seton, has written several
fine I'HmkS on the American Indian. She
feels that, since the U.S. Department of
the Interior has closed the arts-and-
Crafts departments in most government
Indian schools. "It is highly desirable
that the techniques and the lore of these
only truly American folk be put into
permanent form for a later generation
which might perhaps be wiser than the
present generation in the realization of
fundamental values.”

She points out that the art of the
Indian is an integral part of his every-
day life, his every act an art expression.
He had to develop a skill in creating the
artifacts of daily life. These he learned
to decorate, often for religious purposes.
Based on her years of study and obser-
vation, she has learned that “The Indian
is a born artist and a truly creative
worker.” Her book presents many of
his vanishing arts and handcrafts.

The topics covered are the dwellings
of the different tribes and there are
ilustrations, many of them drawings
by the author’s husband, showing how
these were built. Clothing, weaving,
leather, beading, quill work, jewelry,
hasketry, pottery, pipes, musical instru-
ments, and pictorial arts are treated in
the same manner, making the book a
splendid reference for recreation lead-
ers and teachers. Each chapter is fol-
lowed by a bibliography and suggested
reading. This is a very informative and
interesting book.——Mary B. Cummings.

Recreation in the Senior Years, Ar-

thur Williams. Assaciation Press, 29]
Broadway, New York 7. Pp. 252.
$3.95.

Arthur Williams’ new book is a must
for all professionals in the field of ger-

ship, organization, facilities, and finan-
cing. Aspects of program activities in-
clude social, physical, special events,

Mr. Williams’ Recreation for the Aging
which received world-wide acclaim.
This book is a much-needed revision for
the many helping others to “Live Long

and Like It.”—-—Carol Lucas, Edi).

tional Recreatian Association after

RHYTIIMIC ACTIVITIES, Series IV,
Frances R. Stuart, Virginia L. Bigson,
and Arden Iervey. Burgess Publishing
Company, 426 South Sixth Street, Min-
neapolis 15. File of 79 cards. $2.50.

taining a card index and description of
various types of dances. This series is
designed for use by teachers and leaders

through ninth grades. The cards are
classified by grade levels, and by special
days, since most of them are adapta-

IDEAS FOR SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS,
Ronald Benrey. Arco Publishing Corn-
pany, 480 Lexington Avenue, New Y or}:
I7. Pp. I39. $2.50. In 1962, more than
947,000 students entered science fairs
connected with the National Science
Fair-International. In its simplest form,
a science fair can be organized around
an informal gathering of students who
share common interests or hobbies.
This book covers the history and set-up
of science fairs, the planning, research,
and presentation, and gives sample pro-
jects from the investigation into the Os-
age orange (hedge apple) to construc-
tion of a wind tunnel for rocket aero-
dynamics. Science projects open many
program possibilities.

ACTION SONGS AND RHYTHMS FOR CHIL-
DREN, Lois Lunt Metz. T. S. Deni-
son and Company, 321 Fifth Avenue
South, Minneapolis 15. Pp. 110. $4.95.
Songs and words with directions for
rhythmic action, that can be performed
informally by children or for an audi-
ence. The collection includes “Shoot an
Arrow,” “Night Noises,” “Lead a Yell,”
and thirty-two others. Additional sug-
gestions are offered for the rhythmic
presentation of the songs and simplified
costuming. Children will enjoy doing
these songs to rhythmic action, but one
cannot but feel the activity would be
more valuable to them if the children
created their own rhythms and actions
in accordance with the topic, music, and
words. However, the author says:
“Song-and-rhythms work play a large
part in the full development of the child.
. . . Only by participation can hc de-
velop. . . . His creative growth is accom-
plished by stimulating his imagination,
his means of expression, himself, his
ideas.” Piano accompaniments are pro-

vidcd.
